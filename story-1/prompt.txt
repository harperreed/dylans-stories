Crap, I was late. That was the mantra of my life. I had gotten the signal on my X4 hero phone that there was a robbery in progress at 1st Singles Bank and Trust. And I swear I got moving right away. It was clear that I should have spent a more time practicing getting my costume on.
What should have taken a couple of minutes took me almost twenty. Then I had to get the GPS to work on my X4 to give me the best route to the bank. Needless to say I arrived about the time the police showed up.
I pulled up in my Super Smart Car and leapt out like I was going to save the day. The cops just looked at me and sighed. I get that reaction a lot when I first encounter law enforcement. It might have something to do with my suit.
The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots
