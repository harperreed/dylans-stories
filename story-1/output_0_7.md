**Crap, I was late. That was the mantra of my life. I had gotten the signal on my X4 hero phone that there was a robbery in progress at 1st Singles Bank and Trust. And I swear I got moving right away. It was clear that I should have spent a more time practicing getting my costume on.**

**What should have taken a couple of minutes took me almost twenty. Then I had to get the GPS to work on my X4 to give me the best route to the bank. Needless to say I arrived about the time the police showed up.**

**I pulled up in my Super Smart Car and leapt out like I was going to save the day. The cops just looked at me and sighed. I get that reaction a lot when I first encounter law enforcement. It might have something to do with my suit.**

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

As I ran up to the cops, they both looked at me and one of them said, "Oh great. The Super Squirrel is here to help."

"I got here as fast as I could," I said. "But, I got held up by my own incompetence."

"It's okay, Squirrel," said the cop. "It's all over. We've got the robbers in custody."

"Great," I said. "What do you need me to do?"

"There's not much to do," said the cop. "Just look like you're taking charge of the situation. It will be a nice photo op."

I nodded and started walking around like I was doing something. I had been a superhero for a few years, but I had never had a chance to be in the media. I was trying to be a bit more serious, though I knew it would be tough.

"Hello, I'm Super Squirrel," I said to a camera man who was looking for someone to interview.

"Okay," said the camera man. "Just smile and try to look serious."

I smiled and tried to look serious. I'm not sure how well I did, but I was still a hero, and I could make the world a better place. I had to do that before I could worry about my career.

**Crap, I was late. That was the mantra of my life. I had gotten the signal on my X4 hero phone that there was a robbery in progress at 1st Singles Bank and Trust. And I swear I got moving right away. It was clear that I should have spent a more time practicing getting my costume on.**

**What should have taken a couple of minutes took me almost twenty. Then I had to get the GPS to work on my X4 to give me the best route to the bank. Needless to say I arrived about the time the police showed up.**

**I pulled up in my Super Smart Car and leapt out like I was going to save the day. The cops just looked at me and sighed. I get that reaction a lot when I first encounter law enforcement. It might have something to do with my suit.**

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

The reason for the squirrel mask was simple. My superpower is the ability to summon squirrels. I can summon as many squirrels as I want, and I can make them do whatever I want. The squirrels can only do one thing at a time, so I had to have them do a variety of things.

I had them all doing various acrobatics as I jumped up on a nearby building and posed. This was one of my favorite moments of being a superhero. This was the moment that I showed the world what I could do. I wasn't the best superhero in the world, but I was a good one.

It was all over pretty quickly. The police took statements from the witnesses and I used my squirrels to get the robber to confess. The bank was saved and the bad guy was taken away.

After that I spent a little time doing the PR thing. I had to get pictures with the cops, the witnesses, and the bank employees. I was able to get a picture of me and the bank manager and I used it to get free checking for a year.

The last thing I had to do was get a picture with the heroes. I could have done it before I went in to stop the robbery, but I like to do the PR thing last. It is the one part of my job that I really like.

The other heroes that showed up were Nightmist, Super Duper, and Cheetah. Nightmist is the leader of the team. She's got the ability to control darkness and use it to fly. Super Duper is a big strong guy who can make super duper sandwiches. Cheetah can turn into a cheetah and run really fast.

They are all really good heroes, but I was the best one on the team. That was why I was leader.

"Hi, team," I said. "How was your day?"

"Good," said Nightmist. "I saved a family from a burning building. The fire department was already there, but I needed to help them save the family."

"I had to help with a hostage situation," said Super Duper. "A bank robber had taken a bunch of people hostage and he was going to kill them. I had to stop him before he did."

"I had to stop a mugging," said Cheetah. "I got there too late to save the victim, but I stopped the criminal."

"You're all doing great," I said.

and to press conferences. I looked like a giant squirrel. It was the most absurdly ridiculous costume I could have come up with.

I leapt off the car and dashed to the bank's door. It was already open, but I leapt inside and prepared to defend the helpless civilians. I immediately encountered the robber.

He was a short man in a business suit with a briefcase. The man just stared at me and then calmly walked out of the bank. I chased after him.

"Freeze! I'm Squirrel Girl, the hero!" I called out.

"I don't think so." The man replied.

"I'm here to stop you and I will stop you." I called out.

"I'm here to stop you and I will stop you." The man replied.

"What are you talking about?" I asked.

"I'm talking about the game." The man replied.

"Game?" I asked.

"I am the robber." The man replied.

"But you just walked out of the bank." I replied.

"I'm the robber." The man replied.

"You're just saying that." I replied.

"I'm the robber." The man replied.

"Stop saying that." I called out.

"I'm the robber." The man replied.

"You're just trying to get me to stop chasing you." I called out.

"I'm the robber." The man replied.

"But you just walked out of the bank." I called out.

"I'm the robber." The man replied.

"You're the robber." I called out.

"I'm the robber." The man replied.

"I'm the robber."

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

It's just that I'm not the kind of guy you expect to see in a Squirrel Girl costume. I'm not big on exercise. I'm 5'8" and weigh 190 pounds. I'm not really fat, but I'm not skinny either. My hair is a mess of red curls and I have a long scraggly beard.

I know I look more like a guy who would work at a comic book store than a superhero.

The cops just stared at me as I stepped forward and said, "I'm Squirrel Girl."

"And we are in the middle of a robbery," one of the cops said. "We'll handle this."

"I was called in," I said. "And it's not your jurisdiction. I'm a member of the Great Lakes Avengers."

"That's great," the cop said. "Now step aside and let us do our job."

"No," I said. "I have a call out."

"And I have a warrant," the cop said. "Now get out of the way or I'll arrest you for interfering with a police officer."

"You wouldn't," I said.

"Try me," the cop said. "Now step aside or I will arrest you."

I sighed. I hated when this happened. People who had no idea what they were doing kept telling me to step aside. It was like I was the one doing something wrong.

I had thought the whole point of being a superhero was that you didn't have to step aside. That you were the one doing the right thing.

The cops grabbed me and shoved me against the car. One of them started reading me my rights.

"I'm a lawyer," I said. "You can't arrest me for interfering with a police officer."

"You don't have a law degree," the cop said. "So I can't be sure."

I sighed. This was not going the way I had expected. I should have had a little time to explain to the cops that I was here to help. And they should have welcomed my help.

"Hey," I said. "This isn't how it's supposed to go."

"What?" the cop said. "You want me to kiss your ring?"

"No," I said. "This is supposed to go like this."

I then did a series of back flips and cartwheels.

"This," I said as I landed. "I'm supposed to

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

I was a Squirrel Girl. The worlds first, and only, female superhero. And I had a lot to live up to. The original Squirrel Girl, Nancy Whitehead, had become a cult figure after her death fighting Kraven the Hunter.

I'd been studying the adventures of the original Squirrel Girl for years. I was determined to do her justice.

And I thought I had a great new take on the character. Sure, Nancy had fought the Mole Man, Dr. Doom, and the Green Goblin. I was going to fight bank robbers. It was a fresh new direction.

But the cops just looked at me like I was some nutcase.

"Uh, Squirrel Girl? We've got this. Why don't you run along?"

"You have got to be kidding me. I'm a hero. I can help."

"Really? What can you do?"

"I can stop bad guys. Like this!"

I leapt forward and went to punch the robber. He turned and smiled at me. He had a ski mask on and his head was shaved. He was huge. I was a skinny girl with no muscles. He had a gun. I had a tail.

I looked at him and said, "That's what I thought."

The cops stared at me and then burst out laughing. I'm not kidding. They were laughing at me.

"What? I'm serious."

"I'm sure you are, Squirrel Girl. We've got this. Why don't you run along?"

"Look, I can help. I've been training with the best."

"I'm sure you have. Why don't you go help someone else?"

"Look, Squirrel Girl. We're busy. Why don't you go chase some nuts or something?"

"Are you serious? I can do this."

"No. You can't. Now get lost."

I looked at the robber. He was busy trying to open the bank vault. He hadn't noticed me. I had to prove to these guys that I could help.

I looked around. I needed a distraction. I looked at the cops. They were still laughing. I turned to the robber. He was still working on the vault.

I looked at the cops. I looked at the robber. I had an idea.

I waited until the robber got the vault open and was busy trying to figure out how to get the money out. I turned to the cops and yelled,

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

I had been Squirrel Girl for almost two years. Ever since I got the power to talk to squirrels and understand their language. It had started when I was a sophomore in college and was trying to write a paper on the Great Depression. I was just typing away when a squirrel jumped on my desk.

"Hey there. I am going to write a paper on the Great Depression. Can you help me?" I asked.

The squirrel just sat there and stared at me.

"Oh come on. You know you want to help me with my paper."

Still nothing. I sighed and turned back to my computer. The squirrel just sat there.

"I guess you aren't interested in helping me with my paper."

The squirrel tilted its head and then said, "You are interested in writing about the Great Depression. You know that it is going to make you depressed. Why would you want to make yourself depressed?"

"I don't know. I guess I just want to write a paper on the Great Depression. It is a great topic."

"But why do you want to make yourself sad?"

"I don't know. I just want to write a paper on the Great Depression."

"If you write this paper you will be sad. Is that what you want?"

"No. I guess I don't want to make myself sad."

"Then why do you want to write this paper?"

"I just want to write a paper on the Great Depression."

"Then you should write a paper on something else. Why do you want to make yourself sad?"

I just sat there staring at the squirrel. It sat there staring back at me. I didn't know what to do. Finally I just said, "Fine. I will write a paper on something else."

And I did. I wrote a paper on why the Great Depression was so depressing. I got an A on the paper. I even got an A in the class. It wasn't until later that I realized the squirrel had given me the power to talk to squirrels and understand what they were saying.

It was also later that I realized the squirrels didn't really care about me. They didn't want me to be happy. They just didn't want me to be sad.

It took me a while to figure out that it was the squirrels who were in charge. The squirrels wanted me to go out and fight crime. They thought that if I stopped crime I would be happy

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

The cops asked me what I was doing there. I explained that I was Squirrel Girl and that I was there to save the day. The cops looked at me like I was crazy.

The Chief asked me if I was nuts. I told him that my alter ego was Doreen Green and that I was an Avenger. He said that he was pretty sure that was a comic book and that I wasn't an Avenger.

I told him that I had super powers and I could prove it. I told him that I could get a nut off of a tree that was thirty feet away. He said that he would bet that I couldn't. I told him that if I couldn't do it I would give up crime fighting and become a preschool teacher. He said that he would bet $20 that I couldn't.

I took off running and leapt into the air and landed on a branch. I was going to do it. I was going to get a nut off of a tree. I couldn't. I didn't even come close.

I had to pay the Chief $20. And I had to stop crime fighting. I am currently a preschool teacher. I'm pretty sure I am not a super hero.

Anyway, the point of the story is that Squirrel Girl is a bad ass. She might not be a super hero, but she's still pretty awesome.

There is a great Squirrel Girl story by Ryan North and Erica Henderson in the current volume of the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. The story is called Squirrel Girl Beats Up The Marvel Universe.

And that is why Squirrel Girl Beats Up The Marvel Universe is the best comic book of the year.

Now, let me talk about why Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is the best comic book of the year.

Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is the new book from Ryan North and Erica Henderson. It is the best comic book of the year.

The story is a classic Squirrel Girl story. Doreen Green is a college student. She's not sure what she wants to do with her life. She has some money. She has a really cool squirrel costume. And she has the power to talk to squirrels.

She also has the power to beat up the Marvel Universe.

The way that works is that she has a device that lets her control her squirrel friends. And she can summon an army of squirrels. And when she does that, she can beat up the Marvel Universe.

And she does.

She starts out with the Abs

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

I had to admit, I looked like a squirrel. And when I talked it sounded like a squirrel. But the name of my hero was Super Squirrel.

I had been getting in trouble for a while, doing things like punching out guys who made fun of squirrels. I was on the way to getting arrested when I had my big idea. I would become a crime fighter. And I would be a squirrel. And I would use squirrel puns.

That's when I got my hero name. And the rest was history. I went on to have an illustrious career fighting crime as Super Squirrel. And it was an illustrious career. I mean, I did very little fighting and very little crime fighting. Mostly I was just an embarrassing hero who drove people away.

It was all very embarrassing. But I got a couple of groupies who followed me around on a red carpet. I never got their names, they just called me "Squirrel Lover." They had a squirrel flag and a drum and they would follow me around.

So, yeah, my first day out in the Super Squirrel costume was not a great success. The police officers just laughed at me and told me to get lost.

"Who do you think you are, Super Squirrel?" said one cop.

"Squirrel lover," said the other cop.

"I know," said the first cop.

And then they laughed at me some more. And that was that. I packed up my Super Smart Car and went home.

And that's where I ran into the first of my problems. I couldn't get the costume off. It was stuck to my skin. I could move around fine. But I couldn't get the costume off.

It took me a while to figure out what was going on. But when I did I had to admit that it was a pretty good trick. The costume was made of a special polymer that could bond to my skin. I could peel it off if I was willing to destroy the costume.

I really liked that costume. It was very flattering. And the tail was pretty awesome. And the costume was expensive. So I wasn't willing to destroy it. And I couldn't find a solvent that would break down the polymer.

So I was stuck as Super Squirrel. And I had to admit that there was no way I was going to be able to get a new costume made. I didn't have the money.

But I had to do something. So I went to the internet and started

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**

I have a real name, which is Daffy. But I go by Squirrel Girl, and I was pretty sure that I was late because I had had to look up the address on the internet. My GPS wasn't the greatest, and I just couldn't get it to give me directions to 1st Singles.

I looked at the bank. It looked like a mess. I was really hoping that I wasn't too late.

I was just about to run into the bank when a car pulled up. A man got out and I realized that it was Iron Man. He looked at me and asked me if I was here for the robbery.

I looked at the mess of the bank and then back at Iron Man. "I don't know, am I?"

"Well I was here for the robbery. But it looks like the police have everything under control."

"But I was late. I can still be useful. I'm sure that there is something that I can do to help."

"I'm sure you could. But the police seem to have everything under control. So I'm going to go back to my mansion and chill out. I'm sure that you can handle things from here."

And with that Iron Man flew off. I just stood there and watched him go. I wasn't really sure what to do. I had a pretty good idea of what was going on, but I didn't know how to stop it.

The bank robber was named Stilt-Man. He had been sent to the bank by the Tinkerer. He had been sent to get a list of all the clients who had placed large orders with the Tinkerer.

I wasn't sure how to get Stilt-Man to give up the list, but I was pretty sure that I could get it. Stilt-Man had been captured by the police, but I was sure that he wouldn't be in jail for long. I just had to figure out a way to get him out.

I stood there thinking about what to do. And then I saw a group of kids looking at me. I had been so distracted that I hadn't noticed them before. I figured that I could ask them for help. I walked over to them and asked if they could help me with something.

"Sure, Squirrel Girl. What do you need?"

"I'm here to stop the bank robbery. But I can't seem to figure out how to do that."

"That's
