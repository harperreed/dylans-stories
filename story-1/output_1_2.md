**Crap, I was late. That was the mantra of my life. I had gotten the signal on my X4 hero phone that there was a robbery in progress at 1st Singles Bank and Trust. And I swear I got moving right away. It was clear that I should have spent a more time practicing getting my costume on.**
**What should have taken a couple of minutes took me almost twenty. Then I had to get the GPS to work on my X4 to give me the best route to the bank. Needless to say I arrived about the time the police showed up.**
**I pulled up in my Super Smart Car and leapt out like I was going to save the day. The cops just looked at me and sighed. I get that reaction a lot when I first encounter law enforcement. It might have something to do with my suit.**
**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
I am sure this is hard to picture so just go with me on this one. There were little whiskers, two eye holes, and a little nose. It was a good squirrel face though. People really seemed to like it, but those cops didn't seem at all impressed.
The biggest clue was that the cops were covered in blue fur. Oh, you didn't know? Everyone in the city had a bottle of Furry Pills in their medicine cabinets. It was an incredible success and every wound was getting quite a bit of fur. So What? Why are you looking at me like that? Fur isn't gross. You have fur, I have fur. It's what we are.
Why? Why? I know that practically no one is safe to be around me, but Sigh! One of the cops put his finger to his little furry ear and spoke into it. I could see him even if no one else would. I hated to think there was something wrong with my hearing. I did have go see the doctor the other day.
"Sheriff Wolf is on his way. He'll be down in a moment. Had a squirrel issue. Everything under control.
Grizzled and old, wolf sheriff gave a snort to the busybody who called him. The damn fools had already cuffed him. "It's not like he is going anywhere. Did you get the money?"
"The witnesses are all cagey. I think they were intimidated. No one saw anything"
Shit. I thought dealing with ghosts and imaginary friends was my biggest challenge but taking strange wouldn't even speak to me... let us leave that aside for a moment. There seemed to be lots of fur lately. And not my release of energy. Real fur. The weight of the city was getting the plush fur. What could I do with that?
At some noise I couldn't hear, my vexation was distracted by blaze of lights on and my mask was temporarily overcome by the blaze of strobes.  The hostages had been chained to the desks. The robber seemed to be packing up but still unarmed.
"Everything alright chief?" I asked cautiously.
Sally May was ahead of the game, but she was new to the 3rd precinct. She had purple and orange spandex with orange fur. "Yes. Everything is under control. We have the robber in custody. The more difficult thing is going to be getting the hostages to give us any information. We aren't

The police officer looked at my overly complicated belt of gadgets that I had on to show just how super smart I was.
"What are you supposed to be?" she asked.
"The Squirrel Avenger. And you are." I said addressing the winged fox in the banana boots who was leaning against one of their police cars.
"Kitty Paw. Just here to watch the train wreck." she said to let me know I wasn't her priority.
Then young man came out of the bank in full Golden Gloves gear. The red and gold on his two-tone tiara's just blurred a little when I tried to focus my eyes.
"Holy crap. He is here. Don't make eye contact." Spider Widow said.
"Spider Widow, huh?" I asked.
"Sasha Ira. Let me know if you need the hero identification services." she said off handing me a business card.
Then I turned back to the bank robber who was still a blur. "King Tut, wishing all the greats at first singles, the Pharaoh's blessing."
I started to walk forward and pick out the blur. A moment later I was smacking my head into the bleachers at the nearby stadium. They were out of sight of the bank. Sasha tried to suppress her laugh.
Spider Widow said, "You should have tuned out with me, Squirrel Girl. This should be funny." There was a tear in her voice.
I went back in after my first failed attempt. This time I thought I attacked a statue. Ky promised me he wasn't going to do one of those gag jokes. Wasn't that what the cops said once too?"
"Good going, Bucky. You've seriously pissed him off." Spider Widow said.
A quick assessment of the situation revealed that Golden Chance was in fact a statue. What was it about his tiara's that did it?
"That was just stupid." Kitty Paw said.
The tailor that made my super suit was the same guy who made Golden Chance's. He promised me the suit had no malfunctions. I wasn't going to let him live this one down.
"It seems that the suit has turned him to stone." I said in the most serious tone I could manage.
"You think?" Spider Widow asked.
"Oh yeah. Carbonadium in his belt. I got this." I said trying to keep the situation upbeat.
Before stepping up my offense, I checked on the feedback metrics

"Hold it right there," said the senior officer. Even after years of being a hero he could see I didn't blend in with most people. He had a point.
Why should I be surprised. I stood out pretty badly. To be honest, everyone in the Super Squad does. Super heroes and heroines weren't the norm and we all knew it. It was our chance to shine. To give people hope that maybe they could make a difference in the lives of so many. But still I looked at all the equipment at the police station. Not to mention all the people in the waiting room. It was...well, it was disheartening.
"Come inside," said another deputy. The officer let that slide. He probably thought it was a journalist. In a way that was true. Even at my worst I couldn't completely lose my job. I've been a tabloid journalist for decades and still was.
I left the car parked behind city hall and followed the cops into the station. I got the sense they weren't really happy with having to waste time with the robbery. Often, if it was clear that the crime was just a robbery they would let it slide. The bank had insurance since the supervillain A.E.R.(Arson Everywhere Raptor) frequently burned down his targets. They only had to worry about the appearance of allowing him to rob them. Super Villains didn't follow the same rigmarole as supervillains so it was something of an extra hassle.
That was why all the deputies and cops waited until the two superheroes showed up. I watched from the back as two of the deputies manhandled a masked man. They had on the uniform locals called the "Inflate Mono-tactic". An all blue tight suit except for a platinum Sash wrapping around their waist and past their butt to form an S. It was like the old skater uniform except a collective effort of all the deputies who in spite of being the second largest department next to the State Police did their own air and water rescue as well as traffic control.
Inflate Mono-Tactic: Sudden Change, Comeback Kid, Static Maneuver
Even with the platinum glow around his wrists and the fringe on his vest he didn't have the same presence as the red and blue people carrier called the Statesman. The miniature atmosphere and barrier around his helmet scintillated about him. A strange cardboard contraption floated at his side. Yes, I did my research.

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
The problem with my costume, my car and my mask was that I was an obscure superhero called Super Duper Squirrel. I had underage superpowers that allowed me to leap incredible distances and that allows me to get into college.
See my inner clock is ticked at eighty-eight beats per minute instead of the normal seventy two. That equates to about 35% mobility than normal hot shots. That allowed me to be the Super Duper Squirrel.
But today I was being used by the police for crowd control. Everyone else in costume and with a goddamn cell phone kept showing up and demanding to be part of the "hero" show. Amateurs. You show up to the crime, find the criminal of whatever happens and if you are a superhero you probably stop them and save the day. The local TV news trucks try and banana-up the story with their favorite psychobabble.
A lot of people like to pretend to be superheroes just for the cool prizes and glory. That was not me. I was the real deal. Everything about me screamed that. I certainly didn't feel that way when I showed up to a crime and almost twenty other people in costume were huddle around the police.
The cops saw me and waved me over. "It's all cleared out Chief." I reported.
The chief looked at me and shook his head. "Thanks Super Duper Squirrel. You ass-wipes just keep that damn adamantium squirrel off my back. What say?" He complained me.
"Well duh. Of course I'll stay offsides." I said with smile. That man was just mean.
"Right." he said bored and walked over to the TV crews. He tolerated my entry in the Super group called the Squirrels because of my performance in the mass train wreck a few months ago.
A group of college students was on a secret field trip to a nuclear power plant. They were part of a Physics class and were visiting it. None of them had been told of the danger of radiation since of it was a politically charged issue.
Anyway, they were led on a tour through the plant by a tough but beautiful single blonde instructor who might have used a matter transporter as she never left the group's sight. When the tour was over they piled on a train that ferried the students back home. They talked about what the learned and giggled about unknown but faintly physical feelings that had been stirring from the unknown effect of the field trip.
Well, the comic book

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
(good thing that wasn't the route I ended up going with my Hero name).
So I leapt over the police pathway with a flick of my tail and looked for the criminal. An Asian man with a black mask over his eyes and a red scarf tied over his nose and mouth was behind a card table. He held a gun at the head of a teller. "All of the money in the till now, you hear me!"
(Trainers & Duelists #1)
"Let her go!" I shouted. I pulled out a pair of shocking gloves from my utility belt. The criminal whipped his head in my direction. "What the he-!"
The cops were pointing their guns at me. "Officers, don't shoot!"
The criminal broke his hold on the hostage and stepped back from the counter. I lunged forward with four of my legs and hit him in the chest with my tail. He went flying backward out of the bank. I turned to face the cops. "Not one more step and you let me handle this."
"I've had cops pointing guns at me before." The criminal was picking himself off the sidewalk. "Gonna need something better than a swat on the nose to stop me, Squirrelgirl." He ran back through the door.
I ran behind him and leapt into the air. I shoulder checked him hard enough that he slammed into the opposite wall of the bank. The cops yelled at me over their walkies. I couldn't hear them. My ears were filled with a sudden ringing and the impact of the criminal trying to get up again knocked me onto my back.
Over the ringing I did hear the teller screaming for the police. The criminal grabbed and ran again. Behind him I heard the distinctive sound of a taser being fired.
The criminal stumbled and caught himself against a wall. The cops caught me, "What the hell are you doing here?"
"That man tried to rob this bank." One of the cops pointed at the criminal pinned to a wall, "And she helped."
A police officer pointed at me, "Both of you stand back!" She pointed the taser at the criminal.
He was shaking, "No, I'm not going back to prison!" The criminal turned his head towards me. His eyes and teeth shined in the gleaming light of the hallway.
The ringing was still in my ears and I realized his teeth were made of bone as his mouth opened wide.
To this day I

I came across like one of those people who freaks out during an episode of To Catch A Predator but now I had to save a bank. To my credit it was my first time.
My Spandex and my armor was mostly a style thing. A decided to reinforce my costume against bullets and claws after I whipped up some vibrators in home college lab.
I was greatly mutating the right frequency could knock a guy out. But I discovered that just having them turned on wasn't enough. I needed something to act as a radio transmitter to make them work. Plus I could control the frequency I hit the bad guys. So I enhanced my costume with vibrators of every frequency I could think of.
Suffice to say right after crime stopped being about catching criminals it was about stopping the worst guys from getting their hands on my sweet sweet ass. I often told myself I needed to be more professional. And less super horny.
My latest costume added a polarized nuke-proof metal eye mask over my super duper squirrel mask. And added my anti-glare eye protection over that. My self-modified rebreather was under my nose. It gave me a better field of view and the nose part located and filtered out all the tear gas so I didn't fog my eye protection lenses.  I also heavily armored my chest. To stop bullets in case of a cock-up. I often told myself I was going to get hit one day while affected.
All in all I think I had my bases covered except for super popularity. Hence the eights and fives on my Amazon reviews. And I was sure I read somewhere writing books under a superhero name would increase your book sales.
I pulled out my modified foam dart gun which could fire one or eight little rings. I could fire one or load them in multiples for more damage. I had taped an airsick bag filled with tear gas to my wrist. I was a well prepared squirrel.
Without much I heroic dramatics I went in through the broken window as the police responded, writing their report as they asked who I was and what I was doing, and if I saw who had robbed the bank. I told them at about the same time as they told me they had the bank's security cameras. To my credit it was about the same minute despite me going to school to become a mutant crime fighter rather than trail the guys getting caught on camera. I could have done everything they were doing from the comfort of my home office but

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
It forced me to walk around hunched over and with a limp whenever I wore it, not that someone as attractive as me had any problems attracting female attention. But it did not make me look like someone you would want to meet in a dark alley at night.
I extended my hands and got ready to fight. I have no idea why I was thinking like a Pokémon. Instead of a Poké Ball I had the Bank Kenrob Key in one hand and the Scarface Safe Company Safety Token in the other. I was an armed superhero.
I concentrated and my arms became squirrel paws. I opened my mouth and began to say something in my squirrel language. The cops just backed away from me slowly. I was surprised they were that nervous until I noticed that my squirrel was black and it was night and there was a sign on the bank saying the alarm was still on. Like say hello to my flunky!
I quickly shook off the transformation and concentrated.
"Armed Robbery In Progress!" I spoke to the cops in a commanding voice.
"Thank you for stopping by. Permission to come aboard, Archer?" Came a smooth familiar voice.
"Oh robbery in progress? How apropos! Actually I wish you hadn't stopped by." Said Fingers. "I was just about to rob the bank and your stunt bad timing has revealed us to the police."
I followed her gaze to the bank and saw the shadowed figure just inside the bank entrance. The cops drew their weapons and began to circle around the bank moving toward the entrance. With Fingers watching them it would be hard for them to get a shot on the robber before he pulled the alarm and my car began to deflate.
"Oh, very sneaky Fingers." I said in a smooth suave voice that sadly not one bit like John Shaft.
"I got the old mind trick going." Fingers replied.
And then it hit me. Fingers did not look as light as she could be. A cold chill ran through me. Then my mind shifted and as it turned out it was cold where I was. Then as I slowly floated away from Fingers the whole situation made sense. Some people never learn.
~OM Apologetic Squirrel~
I made my way as gracefully as I could back into the bank where Fingers easily resisted my natural urge to leap at her and just seemed not to be there. I had been kidnapped again and again all by the same damn squirrel. She looked both

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
In full costume, I would have looked like a big, floppy, living conlaw, had I ever done any advertisements.
I ran into the bank, glad that I was a superhero because it was time to kick in some doors and rescue the citizens from the bad guys. I was flying by the seat of my pants and there were gaps in the plan, I had no idea where the bad guys were, or how many.
But I didn't see bad guys, and I didn't see hostages. All I saw were moaning people laying on the floor. Then I got one look at a victim and it did not look right.
"This looks wrong. Crap, we're facing an X-Borg."
That moment was when everything went to hell. The lights went out, my power suit froze up and I froze in place. The next thing I knew some X-Borg was breaking my neck. I guess asking me why my X-Men had a purple an orange squirrel on their team was a little too much. But those X-Borgs got a lot of free drinks for the rest of their stint on the X-Men.
The good news was that we knew a lot about X-Borgs, because they were developed by our nemesis, Hank Wraith. X-Borgs were designed to be super soldiers, with artificial intelligence that kept them in charge. They were also designed to be able to cooperate with other X-Borgs to take down a human that was a superhero.
Before anyone could figure out what was going on about one third of our sneaky band got taken out. Poor Josie got her leg snapped in three places. Two of the X-Borgs stood over her. They glared at each other for a moment, then each one kicked her hard in the leg. Then they went after more of us.
"Aiyo, did you see that?"
"I didn't like it."
"Us neither."
Just a few months ago those guys would have said something that unimaginative. But those were glory days of yore. Now, our ragtag group of superheroes was tagged as The New Renaissance. I kept hoping that one of the guys would come up with a brainwave to figure everything out.
The suit deadened my hearing and stuff, but I knew that super helmets had a pretty decent artificial intelligence built into it. So I enabled it and started talking.
"Okay, brain. Figure out how to

The bank robber walked out of the bank leaving plastic explosives and a detonator behind. I stepped forward to grab them before the police did.
But when I bent to pick up the explosives, something pulled them away. A Dark Blast of some kind, I guessed from the purple flash I saw.
"Why would you do that?" I looked around. Crap.
I wasn't sure what emotions to feel when I ran into my alter ego. After defeating Tabarr, I'd hoped never to see him again. And here he was, pulling the bad guy's plastic explosives away from me. Robert Mack was standing in front of music store. He was about 6'2 and imbedded his raw physical power into each muscle he sculpted. And his body was crowded by rack after rack of CDs. It looked like he was waiting for customers to walk in to the electronics store so he could patter off a riff of dance music.
Gathering my wits, I yelled, "Why does everything have to be your way, Robert!"
Bob's human name was Robert Mack. His super name and identity was Tabarr. And both names were earworms. Tabarr for what it sounded like, a part of a song. But also, because it was the sound a person would make if something punched them in the stomach so hard they lost breath. Mack, because his physique was big, long and strong. And whenever his arms moved, it was like watching a Mack truck move.
Rivalry and working together were like many things in a domestic relationship. We were both very good at one another's strengths and weaknesses. Bob was big and tough. I was small, quick and versatile. Also, being enemies had made us more understanding of each other.
I pointed at the explosives. "He almost set off a bomb and you were supposed to be watching him."
"I was, but then I went into this auditory hallucination." Bob had left his Tabarr costume on. It seemed a clear signal to me that he was ready for a rematch.
I answered, "I thought I'd talk to him before you hurt him. Things confined up when he pulled a gun and zoomed off."
Sure enough, Bob was now ignoring me. Still holding the exploding thing in his hand, Bob started a tune. Then his voice added words to it. "Why does everything have to be your way?"
As we sang the song, Tabarr moved into the establishment. Then Bob broke into

no one on twitter was standing around taking pictures of me in silly costumes. No, I am a crime fighter not a model.
The police hadn't cleared the area yet and there was a pretty excited crowd of onlookers. Luckily they were mostly teen girls who were eyeing me like they wanted to grab a selfie with their favorite crime fighter. Either that or EMTs who were concerned for my well being.
At our age, there are still opinions about what kind of decorum is appropriate for crime fighting.
"Excuse me, Excuse me!," I shouted as people parted for me. "Is someone hurt?"
A teenager with purple hair lowered her camera, and answered me politely. "No one has been hurt."
"That's too, too, too bad. I hate it when that happens. We all need to stick together and be super vigilant. That's my motto." I looked around me. It did seem that no one had taken any hits. "Do we have any suspects?"
The celebrity hero. In comic books we would have snarky one-liners that no one really laughed at. I just looked like an asshole.
The girl with the purple hair shook her head slowly. "No. I guess they got greedy. They lifted $5,719,897 from the vaults."
I smiled, and looked down at my costume. Yep, it was all still there. That outfit actually had everything one might need, except maybe the pockets to store my cookie jars. Instead it had pockets that stored a smoke machine, funnels, pyrotechnic devices, rope, and even a taser. "We'll need to get to the bottom of this mystery. Do you have a camera on your phone?"
It turned out 'we' meant the other police officers. They stayed back and allowed the masses to ask me questions, seemingly content just to keep a crowd at bay.
Guys, it was even on the Channel 7 news. I was a celebrity.
"I was so glad you got here so quickly officer Squirrel," said a teen who was wearing a cardigan. Seriously, who dresses like that in the summer? I was in short sleeves and it was pretty hot out.
"It was a tough fight," I nodded solemnly. Everyone was impressed by my bravery. I didn't mention that I had allowed the Ninja Panda to sneak past me. Now that's how you become an internet sensation on social media.
