**What should have taken a couple of minutes took me almost twenty. Then I had to get the GPS to work on my X4 to give me the best route to the bank. Needless to say I arrived about the time the police showed up.**
**I pulled up in my Super Smart Car and leapt out like I was going to save the day. The cops just looked at me and sighed. I get that reaction a lot when I first encounter law enforcement. It might have something to do with my suit.**
**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
The big feet were a pain, they prevented me from wearing any shoe other than my custom made Hero Sneakers that super buzzed when I took a step. Every other step made super squirrel skitters
The cops called Goldfur Crimefighter in. The big cat had been in the city longer and seemed to have a better relationship with the police. The cops even opened the door for her. They still weren't happy to see her super squirrel pal.
So I didn't complain when she told me to hang with the cops while she interrogated the would be robber Whyzer
I noticed the commotion behind me.
"That isn't him," I shouted. "She hasn't run away from the cops yet, right?"
"Yeah, that was a dry run," she said. "I will find her before she hits another."
"Her?" I said. "Wait. What does you being here have to do with what I saw?"
"She's practicing."
"Uh, I want to help." There's just something in my voice that makes her look at me more seriously. I don't know why some heroes don't like me and the ones that don't are somehow more popular than me.
"You need a bigger build," Cellestia the crime fighter said as she looked at me. "I mean I don't have a heavier set of super squirrel crime fighting gadgets, but you're kinda on the small side?"
"I can make it work," I replied. "I have been featherweight champion for ten years straight."
"You can stay," she said. "But I am bringing a taller crimefighting accomplice. One that can probably help us to stop the Squirrel-Bond!"
And goldfur was gone. Some heroes take and leave without saying a word. This one though took a swig of her beer and tithed to God and she was done
She had an X81 phone to go back to I guess.
So I waited and gave a statement to the cops while the heroes investigated. I tried to explain what I had seen, but when the superheroine did approach I realized that it was fairly evident that I had not seen everything.
"I saw someone," I began.
"Yeah, you saw someone," Goldfur said. She was a pretty nice woman even though she seemed to think that I was a baby. Maybe that's were my height got me? I had to wonder if she wasn't thinking I was a leprech

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
My name is "Hopalong Chintanaut" which is a joke that only my mom seemed to get. In the costume my short legs and arms, combined with the comic silhouette, made me look like that old Warner Bros cartoon character "Squirrel Nutkin." I added the "Hopalong" because…I don't know.
I turned and saw two cops on the roof and a third climbing down the fire escape. The bank was not doing a silent alarm, but they waved. I knew that since I was there they would make sure that the crime scene was intact. I stood there, glancing at the rubble where the bank had been, and took a deep breath. There had been a robbery and if two men had been at large for the last ten years then I guess it wasn't them. I just needed to be sure and a pair of gloves would’ve been nice to have. I was feeling a little depressed as I started to walk a circle in front of the remnants of the bank. The first layer had been concrete. It had been removed to make this bank branch environment even more sterile and controlled. And while the wreckage was all melted a quick glance proved that every item of value could be attributed to the blast radius of the explosion that took out the bank. It sounded like one of those thermongel heckits that had been made covert. I knew that some megarooms had been experimental but that they didn’t have anything that could do this. This was one big hemi that pretty much had to be Cajan or perhaps Jafaran origin. But I was thinking of the Dreamtime Spirit Wars of Old when something caught my eye. I am Chintanaut so my peripheral vision should be the best in the business.
I bent down and picked up what looked like a dime. I wouldn’t have even given it a second glance if not for the blue-white light gently pulsing from in the molten metal. I hooked modified CBM into my X4 and used their protocols . The CBM was either based on an old Lore of Mercury or an Aigaion Artifact. At this point it was difficult to tell which.
I blinked and focused on the area where the treasure had been shoved into the wall. I could literally see erosion. A break in the Earth. A sinkhole that dropped down at least a story. I was looking at a collapsed cavern. I added it to the secure pad and shut everything down. I had a

The cops had corralled a group of about 50 people in front of the bank and were keeping them moving in a circle around the building.
And there were three crime scene investigators dressed in those blue outfits with the white coats. Heck, maybe I would have better luck interrogating the squirrels. I tried to get an inquest but they asked for my credentials and I just had more time to change. Cumber City, Illinois, USA Deer with a gun My phone rang as I was crossing Junction 53 coming from Colwich heading down to end at 64. Once of my talking squirrels Jim said there was a deer with a gun.
It seemed funny to me. I thought it was just one of Jim's pranks, but I am pretty sure Jim would have better access to that joke so I headed toward the scene hoping it would bear out.
Arkansas, USA Deer with a gun Yes my phone rang and there it was Bingo! I was in Yell County headed from 64 to I-40 when it happened, well, happened. Ami, one of many squirrels on my phone app said there was a deer with a gun.
It was called Deer Gun and it opened right up. I said Okay, if you say so. Ami told me she was a prankster so I was itching to get this in before it got any funnier.
Deer with a gun It was right off 64 heading to 40, so took the off ramp toward Martha.
As soon as I pulled in I saw the deer and ran over to see if I could get in on a little squirrel fun. It was a buck with a gun in its mouth.
Cumberland Hole, USA Deer with a rubber band That squirrel Ami just wouldn't let me quit messing with her. The next call was from a motorist she had at Cumberland Hole.
It was a pencil necked little bundle of interesting little furry cups that told me to get over there and arrest that deer for the crime.
Dixie, Virginia, USA Millions of Squirrels I drove for two hours in all directions. At times it was raining so hard I couldn't see the squirrel or the deer. I was pretty sure I went up south even though my GPS told me I went east and backwards. Apparently there was no electric power. Anybody ever told Jim that the best way to prove squirrels and deer can work together is to cause a blackout?
Oh yeah, then I had a bunch of squirrels making fun

So I have a pair of big squirrel ears and a bushy tail so I get it when people look at me and chuckle.
I prefer 'giant magical squirrel.' It adds an air of mystery and intrigue that the lame 'squirrel hero' doesn't have. The 'Vigilante Squirrel" or "The Squirrel" were also rejected as names for a reason. I'm the 'Goddamned Flying Squirrel.'
VFS as I like to abbreviate myself. I'll save the chapter on why I have abbreviations in my name. All you need to know is that GFS doesn't sound as epic as VFS.
As I was saying I arrived, and I was in costume to help with the bank robbery. The cops were on the scene by the time I got within my town's limits. They had a situation. There was a guy with a giant gun who was robbing a bank. Bad Guy looked like a classic town miscreant. I could tell by the moustache.
What should I do? I was upset that I wasn't in time to be a surprise witness. How should I handle this? Suddenly I got this scalp tingling feeling. Like I was doing the right thing. What was I doing? I was a superhero. I decided to leap into action. There weren't that many super heroes flying around these days. Well not flying ones that is for sure. It's a dangerous career.
My identity was secret and I could tell by the look in this Bad Guy's eye that he wouldn't reveal it. Let's get right to it then. As a flying squirrel I can leap up this building and then pine cone toss this moustache guy. It wasn't rocket surgery. I would give Superheroes a whole new reason to use the word pine-cone toss. One I just made up.
That's why I decided to give the moustache man a good ol' pine-cone toss off the roof of the bank. I leapt from the ground, up into the sky. It was a magnificent leap if I do say so myself. With a 'whack' I was on the roof of the bank. Me and Bad Guy both looked at one another and then down off the roof. Superheroes really do have a lot of potential.
I don't know if pine cone tossing is a super power. It is power that I worked on though. Some one I could toss up to two pine cones though.
I was

Look, you just can't buy publicity the way I do. People get on TV or the newspapers and all the cover page of my comics asks them is what rubber mask they're going to wear to the superhero challenge. Give me a break, I'm just trying to make this thing look good.
I call myself 1st Super Squirrel, In Space. It is a stupid name but it's catchy in the way a Vid Pon commercial is catchy. I came up with it on the the drive to the bank. I was not happy at being late for what I was hoping to be a crime spasm. For whatever reason I just didn't get the call until after the robbery had been completed.
The cops though were not a happy bunch at the bank. Most of them were dressed in a brown uniform with a tan net over their face. They said they had called for back up but it wasn't coming.
"So what am I supposed to do?" I said to the police officer who I assumed was the captain. "I'm really the only one around. I will help you apprehend the bank robber," I said.
"There is no reason to apprehend the bank robber," he said.
"What do you mean? The bank robber took 87.5 Billion credits, that's kind of a big deal," I said.
I don't know why everyone got so quiet when I said that. Turns out that it didn't matter how much they took, here on the planet Oornt or as most everyone call it now "The Planet of the Plunderevils". The banks and the government conspired to just give it all back.
The Planet of the Plunderevils
The planet had had a golden age of participation. You could purchase a book, project, or almost anything worth having from crowdsourcing. 42 Percent of the population contributed at least once a year to music, apps, data, blogs, or anything else a creative mind could come up with.
The idea was that if you were going to participate in the economy you should at least get something back from the passion you put into whatever project you tried to help. There were no outside influences. No marketing. No outside opinions on the best choice to make to maximize profits. Just good old altruism.
It worked well for a while. Until there was no new planet to plunder.
Oornt is a slightly depleted planet with a rich history. Most of the planet you just found unusable rock and dust. But

**The suit was purple spandex with orange fur. My mask was designed to make me look as much like a squirrel as possible. There was even a bushy tail that I wore in promotional shots**
That suit was my masterpiece. I had spent the better part of my adult life in attempt to design that costume and I had even better results than anticipated. I not only looked good in it, but I felt just a bit sturdier. I might just be nuts but sometimes the feeling of having a costume on frees you up a bit. This is one of the more dangerous effects that a Marvel Girl can have though.
That was one thing that I was always careful not to do. Never to make myself invulnerable, that would have been wrong. And it might have made me less aware of my surroundings, giving the bad guys a better chance to get to me. Instead I concentrated on agility, awareness and a bit of extra strength, enough to give me an edge if someone picks on me during a heist but not enough to dissuade me. I was able to do anything that I might need to do in a fight. If I had to run, I had legs that moved at least as fast as a normal person. If I needed to escape through a hole I was small enough to make it. I could easily jump since it was one of the powers that I had been given. I suppose any of my powers could come in handy.
My Creator has given me some sort of mutation power that works by touching someone. I'm not sure what makes someone different enough to actually vibrate but every once in a while I'll go so fast that I just…well, vibrate. This makes me pretty fast but it sort of screws up my sense of where I am because it's like feeling yourself move through thousands, millions of perceptions at once. Move just a little too fast and my mind starts to shut down so I'm always careful about that. I use it in a pinch though.
Looking back at it, I probably shouldn't have been wearing a costume I just made if I was as flighty as I am. Oh well, I can always make another suit. There's no law against having more than one set of spandex, right?
"Excuse me officer. I believe I called this in. I'm your witness for the 1st robbery of the month. Twelve confirmed in the vid pic." In addition to my being a bit on the ditzy side I'm also a bit scatterbrained sometimes. I'm El Squirrel, Supermodel and Fashion designer. Wearing a costume of my own making is pretty high up there on being scatterbrained. I'm hoping

I kind of wish they still found that as funny as I do, but they grow up so fast these days.
My armor was bright orange and purple, but it fit me like a glove and made me fast and agile. My name badge said "Super Squirrel. Powered by Fruit'N'Fit and willing to right wrongs." It was something of a cross between a crime fighting martial arts squirrel and an insurance salesman. I can't be too hard on them for their lack of enthusiasm. I am mostly known as a jackass on the internet who has to fight his battles by insult.
However I did some super tweets as Squirrel. I was going to make a few lawyer jokes about getting people to donate money for a school for robot rights at LITA convention, but that would require me to be funny. I am not sure how I would pull that off.
The supersuit wasn't my only costume. Where as Classic Squirrel was the costume I wore when I said, "Think before you do something stupid" and "Here are few tips to stay out of trouble," Super Squirrel was the one to say "ALL GLORY TO SQUIRREL KING."
God, I am supposed to be a grown up and I can't even stop that kind of lame crap. 
Anyways I got out of the car, wanted to say something in my best Squirrel voice and tripped on a crack in the sidewalk. Maybe I shouldn't have worn high heels? I do have my moments of brilliance.
When I recovered and stood up I saw the bank had already been robbed.
It only took two words to capture the scene. There was the roadkill werebear and Geyser Boy. Geyser Boy because that was his only power, shooting a geyser from a gun that froze his foe in ice. People called me Squirrel Girl when I first started, but it didn't get me being compared to a super villain who froze people in ice.
I also hated that the Terminatto scene was from a rape scene in Mad Max.
Bad enough that my first thoughts when I saw the Terminatto were, "Gee, he's huge." I said it out loud.
Everyone ignored me, except The Watch , an Android archer and hypersonic+ classified. 
We had met a few times, but you wouldn't know it by looking at her. I mean she looked like Endgame , who was a rather good looking woman in her statue, or wearing a catsuit

'Look Squirrel Girl, it's no big deal. We've got the scum bag on CCTV going inside 20 minutes ago. The manager had just vacuumed part of the vault. So, you're hardly needed here.' I noticed that the police officer had a tinge of bitterness in his voice.
I nodded and told the team handling the bank job that everything was okay. I'm sure Dr. Doom or Thanos could take care of a bank job. Heck the Leader had done it once or twice. I left a phone number in case something went wrong and drove off.
That was about a Thursday and it was now Sunday afternoon. I got out of the suit. I normally change in the trunk of my car which has plenty of room for a standard size mattress for changing. There is a plastic window on each side for fresh air. But this time I sat in my office and listened to the Avengers news hour on the radio. It really is the best broadcast in the world.
This week the Avengers had found a lost alien space craft and borrowed it to shift their entire mission to outer space. The alien ship had a cloaking device but somehow AIM had tracked it down.
How am I supposed to save the world when the Avengers just up and leave without notifying me first?
Not only did they get AIM on their tails but the military of an alien world. Oh and they had to rescue a space shuttle crew that happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Classic Adam Warlock. Using too much power to protect the innocent is what causes the mistakes he is most famous for.
There was a knocking at my door. I saw a head of red hair under the knob. Darla is my number one fan. I guess I was pretty famous in the comic books. I heard that Stan Lee is still be paid over a million dollars a year just for mentioning my name and for a balloon in the Macy's parade.
"Come in Darla," I said as I pulled on a green chiffon blouse and black pleated skirt. I need to look presentable when eating leg wrestling champion supernatural red heads. I don't have too many of those on my social calendar.
Darla came in and she was twice if not three times my height. She wore a black Iron Man tee and black jeans, which she did so her frame wasn't covered. Her hair was in pigtails, so cute. Her makeup had not changed in twenty years. Her paramour had

Yes, you read right. The suit and Iron Salmon, my name, were the result of a "think different" marketing firm that was trying to get me into the big time superhero ranks. They said I had to stand out and that was how they did it. Scream my name to the heavens. But I thought they were nuts, too.
Be that as it may. I didn't have a whole lot of time to worry about that.
I got on the scene at the exact moment the supervillain, Mewtwo minus, appeared from who knows where.
"So. You've been tracking my chips all this time. You got anything out of them?" He asked in a genteel drawl despite the technicolor costume that he wore that included a giant blond afro on his head.
I had no idea what he was talking about.
He must have taken me staring in confusion as stalling for time or as a challenge. That was when made his move.
"Transform card," he said suddenly and then pointed at the armored car where the cops were taking the money from the vault.
Somehow this caused a ray of light to illuminate the whole armored truck.
Then it struck the money on the truck and started changing it.
Not too sure what was happening, I started punching Mewsomino. I missed, he dodged, and dropped several handbombs that must have been magically contained. Before I could react, one of them exploded in my face.
Fucker.
Now I was pissed. It might have something to do with the fact that blinding light. I shoved Mewtwo Nigger aside and slammed my fists into the truck repeatedly trying to dissipate the energy. The moment that I erased enough to keep it from transforming any more money into one of those furry animals, the super fighting ace – San Bu, a third rate Filipino Superman – dropped from the sky and helped.
He and I punched and blasted away at the money and the super villain. Everything was going pretty well.
Until library lady showed up.
"Get away from the money," she ordered me sternly as she raised her right hand.
"Where's the gratitude," I yelled from inside my Iron Salmon mask. "I'm saving this Super MONEY from disaster or relicing."
"Iron Salmon?" I heard Library Lady say it like she was some kind of librarian Batman. "You're sentimental."
"It was meant to be," I said nobly.

Still I made sure to quickly explain how I could help. The occupants of the bank were being held inside. Two robbers wearing purple and orange outfits, similar if not identical to mine, held the three inside hostage. OK they weren't actually being held hostage, but a couple of clerks were hostage by their fear of what might happen if they disturbed the robbers. I named myself the Squirrel that Roared.
The cops grimaced at that. One asked, "They gave you this name?" "This is me," I said. "It defines who I am." They looked at each other, flanking me as we approached the front of the bank. "Let me deal with this," I said. "The robbers know me, I know a lot about them." They nodded. "Just be careful," said one cop.
"My middle name," I said. Then I took a deep breath and focused. I looked up and heard, "Damn, I forgot how cool it is that squirrels can do that." I looked up and saw the commander of the police task force had arrived and was looking down on me in my Squirrel Hero suit. Being short is just part of being a superhero. It is amazing how growing just a few inches at that moment made me feel so much more confident. I gave him a salute.
And there was The Squirrel that Roared's first act. I leapt up on a wall and scampered up to where the commander and I could talk eye to eye. "Bad cops," I said. "You said they were the ones who gave you this name." "It makes no sense. I've never done anything good for others. Big brother of the street . . ." "You can share my fear," I said. "And if I make a deal with you . . ." "I know what a hostage is," he said. "And that there are two of your brethren up there." "Two robbers," I said. Then I thought I saw the cops creeping in to surround the bank. From my position I was able to send a signal to one of my robo servos. It leapt up to a window, shattered it, and took out one robber with a flying kick. "Whoa," said the commander.
"I know." "You have stolen that robo thing." "Shhh," I said. "The aptly named Mr. Roboto is one of us and he is a Super Hero. He will show no mercy." The robber who was left looked
