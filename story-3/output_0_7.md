**There was the steady drip of water that always seemed to accompany life in the habitat. Glinda had received a note that someone who “knew too much” wanted to meet her or would reveal her secret. Glinda jumped as she heard the sound of metal on metal, a scraping sound that wrenched the ears. Her head snapped towards that sound.She laughed a little as a small crab scuttled across the corridor. Growing up on the surface Glinda had yet to get used to the differences between the Delta P habitat and the surface world. She remembered being fascinated by the habitat when they had first arrived. Right now she wished they were still back home in Iowa. That they hadn’t left the world she knew to pursue a dream, that she now realized was a false dream. Her father had brought them here so that he could work in the kelp farms, but shortly after arriving he had suffered from a decompression accident. After his death all Glinda wanted was to feel the sun warming her skin, as she closed her eyes against its brightness. There was no brightness here. Just the constant oppressing darkness that was cut occasionally by the overhead lights. She got used to the cold, the damp and the noise; but she couldn't get over the lack of decent light. There were rumors amongst the Surfies that the deeper you went into Delta P the more light there was, but Glinda would never make it that deep. Only the elites could go to the tenth level, everyone else just had to make do. Since then Glinda had been looking after her little sister, Esma. Glinda had taken odd jobs all over the habitat but had resorted to selling herself to make ends meet. She felt so ashamed of what she had done, and never wanted Esma to find out. She cleared all thoughts of her crimes from her head and headed towards the rendezvous. She held her right hand up to the scanner and the airlock opened, admitting her into a lift that would take her down a level. The banging of the compressors as they brought the pressure in the lift even with that of the next level filled her ears. She thought she heard a hissing noise but the compressor was so loud that she couldn’t be sure. She had just reached the next level when she saw a hooded figure standing outside of the airlock. She watched in horror as the figure fiddled with the manual controls. The figure looked straight at her as it pulled sharply on one of the wires. The lift started to fill with water.Glinda had been out in the water before but always in a heated suit. At this depth the water was close to freezing. She felt her leg muscles start to seize as she started to scream. The hooded figure just stared at her, impassive as the water reached her chest.Glinda was shaking uncontrollably as the water started to cover her face. The coldness of the water took her breath away, leaving her silent as the water filled the rest of the lift. The hooded figure waited until Glinda was dead and then drained the lift, leaving the girl slumped against the wall, soaking wet.**
Hoping that this was the end of the killings, Paskal T'Aki was awoken in the middle of the night by a strange hissing sound. It was the sound of water coming through the airlock. He sat up in his bed and listened carefully, the sound of the hissing grew louder and louder. Suddenly the sound stopped and he heard the noise of metal being scraped against metal. The sound of the airlock door closing. Paskal knew what was happening, he just didn't want to admit it to himself. He was going to die. The air in the habitat was being slowly replaced with water. There was a hissing sound as the glass in the window started to crack, the water was coming in through the crack, freezing the glass solid. He could see a layer of ice starting to form. It was a futile exercise but he started to bang on the glass, trying to get the attention of the Surfies in the next room. There was no response. He heard a knock on the door and he froze. “Who is it?” he called out. The door opened to reveal Glinda. Paskal could see that she was naked. “I know what you did,” she said, “I know that you killed my sister.” She stepped into the room, her face obscured by her long red hair. Paskal looked around the room for a weapon but couldn't find anything. He moved towards the door, trying to block Glinda’s exit. She pushed him aside with ease. He fell to the ground as he struggled to get to his feet. “Why?” he said, “Why did you kill your sister?” Glinda just stared at him, as the room filled with water. She watched as he struggled to breath, as the water started to cover his face. “She was in the way,” she said, “She didn't deserve to live.” Glinda was one of the Surfies that never made it to the surface. She had always resented her sister for that. It had always been Esma’s fault that she never made it to the surface, that she never saw the sun. The hissing of the airlock continued. It was time for Glinda to go to the surface.

The body was found by a Surfie working on the third level. He had reported the incident to his superiors, but they had been too busy to deal with it. The body was left in the lift, the emergency doors left open so that the water would drain out.
As she lay on the lift floor, Glinda’s hair started to grow. Her skin started to change color, from the soft peach color of a human, to the dark grey of a Surfie. Her mouth opened in a scream as she felt her arms and legs turn to claws. She screamed as her teeth started to lengthen. The last thing Glinda felt before she died was the overwhelming sensation of scales growing across her skin.
At first, the girl didn’t know what was happening. She felt like she was in a dream. She was floating in a void of darkness. She felt as if she was falling, but she had no sense of where she was falling to. She started to scream, but there was no sound. Then she heard a voice. A voice that seemed to be in her head, but she was sure that she had heard it. “I will help you,” the voice said. “If you are to help me, you must help yourself.” “What do you mean?” The voice laughed. “You know exactly what I mean. You have a power, use it.” The girl was filled with fear. She didn’t know what the voice was talking about. “You know what I mean,” said the voice. “You can feel it, deep down inside.” “What is it?” “A hunger, a hunger for the flesh of others.” “No!” The girl screamed. “I don’t want to be a monster.” “Too late for that,” said the voice. “You’re already one.” “I’m not,” she cried. “I’m not.” “Then why do you have these urges?” The voice said. “To feed, to kill.” “I don’t want to.” “You will.” “No!” The voice laughed again. “What is it you really want?” “I want to live

An hour later the lift was emptied and its occupant was removed. The authorities were not called as the girl had obviously broken into the habitat illegally and was just trying to find a way out. She had no identification and no one reported her missing. She was just another casualty of Delta P.
With the girl gone the figure pulled the hood back, revealing a young woman with dark hair. The woman sighed as she went back to work on the wiring. It had taken her months to do the work, to sabotage the elevator, but it was worth it. The upper echelons of Delta P had no idea what was going on below them, they were just interested in maintaining their way of life. The woman had been in Delta P for two years and had worked hard to be here. She knew that if she ever made it to the tenth level she could live a life of luxury, a life she could never have on the surface. She was working hard to get to the tenth level, she just had to make sure that her cover wasn't blown. She didn't know how long it would take but she knew she had to be patient. She looked up at the camera that was observing her. She knew that if she ever wanted to get out of Delta P alive she had to act like she belonged here. She had to forget about the outside world and concentrate on what was going on inside. 
No one noticed the second person in the room. The girl was hiding in the shadows, her dark hair almost blending into the darkness. She watched as the woman pulled the hood back and moved back to work. She stayed there for a while, then disappeared into the shadows. The woman didn't notice her at all.
Chapter 4
Eleanor awoke in a cold sweat, the same dream again. She always dreamed about the night she killed the person she loved the most. She remembered how her mother had died. She remembered the screams as the ball of fire took her mother away. It had been her fault, all her fault. She had been playing with her lighter, the lighter her mother had given her. She had wanted to show it off to her friends, to make them think she was tough. She had just been messing around, but then she had dropped it and it had rolled onto the pile of dry leaves. The leaves had started to burn and the fire had spread. She remembered the screams as her mother had tried to save her. She had screamed and screamed but her mother had died. The fire had taken

When Glinda's father had first arrived in Delta P he had made it his mission to find out the truth behind the secret that the elites kept from the Surfies. He was an idealist who believed in freedom for all. He didn't like the way the elites ran the habitat, with the majority of the workers being expendable and living in poverty. After a few years he had found a crack in the elites' armor. He found out about a meeting that was taking place on the tenth level. He knew that if he could get to the tenth level then he could learn the truth about Delta P. He made his plans and bought an ID card for his daughter, Glinda. She was just a child, but he thought she would be able to slip through the cracks and learn the truth. Glinda didn't know what her father had planned but she knew that it had to be something big. He was too secretive for it to be anything small. She knew that she had to help her father, so she agreed to go to the meeting. Glinda looked at the letter that had been slipped under her door. She looked at the note again and then folded it up and slipped it into her pocket. She headed towards the rendezvous. She had been waiting for this for years. She heard the sound of metal on metal as she neared the rendezvous. The sound of a crab scuttling across the corridor, growing up on the surface Glinda had yet to get used to the differences between the Delta P habitat and the surface world. She remembered being fascinated by the habitat when they had first arrived. Right now she wished they were still back home in Iowa.

The figure stood up and started to walk away. It felt its hood, and was satisfied that it hadn’t been seen. It turned to walk away when it saw the second girl, the girl that had started all of this. It stood in the shadows watching her. She was so innocent, so pure. The figure wanted to take her but it knew that it had to wait. It couldn’t risk being caught. She would be the one to lead them to her sister, to the other Surfies. They would pay for what they had done.
The figure disappeared into the shadows as Glinda’s body was taken to the composters.
Glinda didn’t know why she was being punished. She had done nothing wrong. She had tried to do her best, but she was just a kid. She knew that she should have gone to the authorities but she didn’t know who to trust. Her father had been a petty criminal, he would have known who to go to. She would have to ask the Surfies when she found them.
The world above was a faraway place, a place that Glinda had heard of but never thought she would visit. She was surprised to find out that it wasn’t as bad as she had been led to believe. The surface world had become a police state, the military ruled it. She had heard rumors of the purges but thought that they were just stories.
The authorities had told her that she would have to stay with her grandparents. She didn’t know them very well, they were very old and lived in a nursing home. They were nice to her, they had been nice to her father too. Glinda knew that they had been pleased to see her, but they were so old that they couldn’t really do much. She was surprised to find out that they had an android, an old android but still an android. It had been so long since she had seen one.
It was her grandfather who had told her about the Surfies. He had told her that they were a group of young people who were fighting for her rights. She knew that she would have to join them.
It was a long walk to the city. Glinda had never seen a city before, she had never seen any buildings that were more than two stories tall. She walked for days, she slept when she was tired and ate what she could. The further she walked the more deserted the world became

The girl was small, and still had her diving gear on. She looked like a drowned rat, with long brown hair plastered to her face and water trickling down her back. The man who had been watching the lift shook his head. It was so sad that a pretty young girl had to resort to selling her body to make ends meet. He pulled off his mask and turned towards the girl.
The girl’s eyes snapped open as she gasped for air. Her hands instinctively went to her neck, feeling for the wire that she had worn for so long. She looked around at the unfamiliar surroundings, her mind slowly coming to terms with where she was. She had just had a dream. It had felt so real, but it couldn’t have been real. She wouldn’t have sold herself for money. The idea was abhorrent to her. She turned over in the bed and buried her face in the pillow. She felt the familiar feeling of a deep depression descending over her. She didn’t even know why she was feeling so sad. She tried to remember what the dream was about but it had already started to fade. She tried to hold onto it, but like everything else in her life it slipped through her fingers. She would never know what it meant. She lay there for a while, staring at the ceiling, wondering what to do with her life. She wasn’t sure what she was feeling, but she knew that something had changed. She was ready to get out of bed.

She watched in horror as the figure fiddled with the manual controls. The figure looked straight at her as it pulled sharply on one of the wires. The lift started to fill with water.Glinda had been out in the water before but always in a heated suit. At this depth the water was close to freezing. She felt her leg muscles start to seize as she started to scream. The hooded figure just stared at her, impassive as the water reached her chest.Glinda was shaking uncontrollably as the water started to cover her face. The coldness of the water took her breath away, leaving her silent as the water filled the rest of the lift. The hooded figure waited until Glinda was dead and then drained the lift, leaving the girl slumped against the wall, soaking wet.**
Glinda’s death went unnoticed for a few hours. The compartments that she had rented to the residents of Delta P were out of the way and seldom visited. She was found later that day when her rent didn’t appear in the collection tray. The police began to look into the case, but with the number of deaths in the habitat, Glinda’s murder would take a back seat to more pressing matters. A body was found in the habitat a week later, the cause of death unknown. It was only a few days after that when another body was found. This time it was found in a storeroom, the cause of death was drowning. A week later the police found another body, again the cause of death was drowning. It was another three weeks before the police found the next body. The victim was a known Surfie who had been looking for information on the habitat. The cause of death was drowning, but the odd thing was that the water in his lungs was from the surface, not from the habitat. The water in the habitat had been treated to remove the oxygen. There was something very odd going on in Delta P.
The police brought in more people to try and work out what was going on in the habitat. With the number of deaths rising they couldn’t afford to take their time. People were starting to get scared, with people going missing it was only a matter of time before the whole habitat went into lockdown. They brought in a specialist team from the other habitats, people that had experience dealing with the Surfies. They began to question everyone, including the families of the victims. It was during this questioning that they began to get a clearer picture of what was going on.
The specialist team had noticed that all of the victims were related to each other, and it wasn’t long before they discovered that the families had all come from the same small town in Iowa. They went to Iowa to question the families, and it wasn’t long before they were on the trail of Glinda’s father. He had been a scientist that had worked on a team that had discovered a new chemical compound that could be used as a weapon. It was a weapon that had the ability to kill quickly and quietly. A team had been sent down to the surface to collect samples of the compound. A lot of the team had been killed during the mission and the remaining members of the team had been taken prisoner. Glinda’s father had been killed

**There was the steady drip of water that always seemed to accompany life in the habitat. Glinda had received a note that someone who “knew too much” wanted to meet her or would reveal her secret. Glinda jumped as she heard the sound of metal on metal, a scraping sound that wrenched the ears. Her head snapped towards that sound.She laughed a little as a small crab scuttled across the corridor. Growing up on the surface Glinda had yet to get used to the differences between the Delta P habitat and the surface world. She remembered being fascinated by the habitat when they had first arrived. Right now she wished they were still back home in Iowa. That they hadn’t left the world she knew to pursue a dream, that she now realized was a false dream. Her father had brought them here so that he could work in the kelp farms, but shortly after arriving he had suffered from a decompression accident. After his death all Glinda wanted was to feel the sun warming her skin, as she closed her eyes against its brightness. There was no brightness here. Just the constant oppressing darkness that was cut occasionally by the overhead lights. She got used to the cold, the damp and the noise; but she couldn't get over the lack of decent light. There were rumors amongst the Surfies that the deeper you went into Delta P the more light there was, but Glinda would never make it that deep. Only the elites could go to the tenth level, everyone else just had to make do. Since then Glinda had been looking after her little sister, Esma. Glinda had taken odd jobs all over the habitat but had resorted to selling herself to make ends meet. She felt so ashamed of what she had done, and never wanted Esma to find out. She cleared all thoughts of her crimes from her head and headed towards the rendezvous. She held her right hand up to the scanner and the airlock opened, admitting her into a lift that would take her down a level. The banging of the compressors as they brought the pressure in the lift even with that of the next level filled her ears. She thought she heard a hissing noise but the compressor was so loud that she couldn’t be sure. She had just reached the next level when she saw a hooded figure standing outside of the airlock.

It had been three days since Glinda had been found. The pathologist confirmed that the cause of death was drowning. The computer records of the lift were hacked and it appeared that someone had changed the airlock controls so that they couldn’t be opened from the inside. A security guard had seen a hooded figure tampering with the controls. The figure had escaped through the hole it had cut in the side of the habitat. The cut was crude and was only done with a plasma cutter, no attempt had been made to conceal the damage. It was reported that the intruder had then entered the lift and hacked the controls. The airlock controls had been changed to manual, which is how the intruder had managed to open the airlock. No one had seen the intruder come out of the airlock. The hole in the side of the habitat was patched up and a story circulated that it had been done by a leak in the habitat. The girl had been found floating in the water with the hooded figure standing next to her. The girl had been pronounced dead at the scene. The hooded figure had disappeared, and all attempts to find it had failed. The authorities were at a loss. It was a sad case of a girl who had made a bad choice and was punished for it. No one suspected the truth, that a creature from the deepest parts of the habitat had been released.

I first came across the term “Surfie” when I was researching surf culture in the 1960s and 70s. I didn’t know where the term came from, and at the time I didn’t think to look it up. I just filed it away in my mind, waiting for a time when I could use it. Now that time has come. I have written two other stories set in the same universe as this one, and I have just finished a third. I hope to get it edited in the next couple of weeks and then publish it on Amazon.
