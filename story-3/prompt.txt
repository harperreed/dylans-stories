There was the steady drip of water that always seemed to accompany life in the habitat. Glinda had received a note that someone who “knew too much” wanted to meet her or would reveal her secret. Glinda jumped as she heard the sound of metal on metal, a scraping sound that wrenched the ears. Her head snapped towards that sound.She laughed a little as a small crab scuttled across the corridor. Growing up on the surface Glinda had yet to get used to the differences between the Delta P habitat and the surface world. She remembered being fascinated by the habitat when they had first arrived. Right now she wished they were still back home in Iowa. That they hadn’t left the world she knew to pursue a dream, that she now realized was a false dream. Her father had brought them here so that he could work in the kelp farms, but shortly after arriving he had suffered from a decompression accident. After his death all Glinda wanted was to feel the sun warming her skin, as she closed her eyes against its brightness. There was no brightness here. Just the constant oppressing darkness that was cut occasionally by the overhead lights. She got used to the cold, the damp and the noise; but she couldn't get over the lack of decent light. There were rumors amongst the Surfies that the deeper you went into Delta P the more light there was, but Glinda would never make it that deep. Only the elites could go to the tenth level, everyone else just had to make do. Since then Glinda had been looking after her little sister, Esma. Glinda had taken odd jobs all over the habitat but had resorted to selling herself to make ends meet. She felt so ashamed of what she had done, and never wanted Esma to find out. She cleared all thoughts of her crimes from her head and headed towards the rendezvous. She held her right hand up to the scanner and the airlock opened, admitting her into a lift that would take her down a level. The banging of the compressors as they brought the pressure in the lift even with that of the next level filled her ears. She thought she heard a hissing noise but the compressor was so loud that she couldn’t be sure. She had just reached the next level when she saw a hooded figure standing outside of the airlock. She watched in horror as the figure fiddled with the manual controls. The figure looked straight at her as it pulled sharply on one of the wires. The lift started to fill with water.Glinda had been out in the water before but always in a heated suit. At this depth the water was close to freezing. She felt her leg muscles start to seize as she started to scream. The hooded figure just stared at her, impassive as the water reached her chest.Glinda was shaking uncontrollably as the water started to cover her face. The coldness of the water took her breath away, leaving her silent as the water filled the rest of the lift. The hooded figure waited until Glinda was dead and then drained the lift, leaving the girl slumped against the wall, soaking wet.
