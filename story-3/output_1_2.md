**There was the steady drip of water that always seemed to accompany life in the habitat. Glinda had received a note that someone who “knew too much” wanted to meet her or would reveal her secret. Glinda jumped as she heard the sound of metal on metal, a scraping sound that wrenched the ears. Her head snapped towards that sound.She laughed a little as a small crab scuttled across the corridor. Growing up on the surface Glinda had yet to get used to the differences between the Delta P habitat and the surface world. She remembered being fascinated by the habitat when they had first arrived. Right now she wished they were still back home in Iowa. That they hadn’t left the world she knew to pursue a dream, that she now realized was a false dream. Her father had brought them here so that he could work in the kelp farms, but shortly after arriving he had suffered from a decompression accident. After his death all Glinda wanted was to feel the sun warming her skin, as she closed her eyes against its brightness. There was no brightness here. Just the constant oppressing darkness that was cut occasionally by the overhead lights. She got used to the cold, the damp and the noise; but she couldn't get over the lack of decent light. There were rumors amongst the Surfies that the deeper you went into Delta P the more light there was, but Glinda would never make it that deep. Only the elites could go to the tenth level, everyone else just had to make do. Since then Glinda had been looking after her little sister, Esma. Glinda had taken odd jobs all over the habitat but had resorted to selling herself to make ends meet. She felt so ashamed of what she had done, and never wanted Esma to find out. She cleared all thoughts of her crimes from her head and headed towards the rendezvous. She held her right hand up to the scanner and the airlock opened, admitting her into a lift that would take her down a level. The banging of the compressors as they brought the pressure in the lift even with that of the next level filled her ears. She thought she heard a hissing noise but the compressor was so loud that she couldn’t be sure. She had just reached the next level when she saw a hooded figure standing outside of the airlock. She watched in horror as the figure fiddled with the manual controls. The figure looked straight at her as it pulled sharply on one of the wires. The lift started to fill with water.Glinda had been out in the water before but always in a heated suit. At this depth the water was close to freezing. She felt her leg muscles start to seize as she started to scream. The hooded figure just stared at her, impassive as the water reached her chest.Glinda was shaking uncontrollably as the water started to cover her face. The coldness of the water took her breath away, leaving her silent as the water filled the rest of the lift. The hooded figure waited until Glinda was dead and then drained the lift, leaving the girl slumped against the wall, soaking wet.**
Glinda never made it to the rendezvous on the next level. She had been working on the surface for too long, she had missed the boats and should have gone low down to the holding area to catch the shuttle down to the delta p habitat.  She was pulled out of the water and left to dry for a few minutes whilst a search was made to see if she had any valuables on her. A man approached her as she was drying. "She was patched up as best as could be. She was unresponsive but she needed no medical attention." The man sat in front of Glinda. A large hat hid his face but she could guess who he was. Traede 'Patch' dealer. Smuggler. Assassin.    "Know this." He said, "You have been called to judgment. This will let you move to the next level." Glinda gave no response, preferring to keep her thinking face. She placed her hand on Glinda's neck, feeling for a strong pulse. "She is to answer yes to three questions and one question where the answer is 'no', she is to answer yes to lie, but then, only if she hears the word 'purge'." Glinda was baffled, why would they want her to do this?  Patch looked concerned. "Do you understand the rules?" Glinda nodded in response.   "Then we begin. Have you been in the company of any unauthorised visual or audio information?" Glinda nodded her head. She dearly wanted to hold it but that would be considered a movement. "Good, do you wish to send a message out to the surface?" Without moving a muscle Glinda nodded 'yes'.  "Remember," Patch continued, "You have already been informed of your sentence."   Glinda wanted to scream, she wanted to yell, she wanted to cry, she wanted to run...but she didn't. Her mind raced through scenarios none of which seemed to finish with her alive. The questions continued.    "Do you forgive the people who have sided against you?" Glinda barely registered the question. Both sides were the enemy of her now. They were the ones who stole her livelihood and condemned her family to move around the habitat. She nodded, her first lie.  The words started to run together but Glinda was able to figure out what Patch was asking, for the most part. She had obviously lost her job, and had been caught breaking some serious rules. She was caught in a crime she

After eating a feast fit for a small army Rasta put in a call to his old friend Celestra. After leaving home the two had only stayed in touch halfheartedly, even after they had joined the Hunters. Over time lines of command and friends of technology had broken them apart, much as their home lives had before then. Celestra lived a few levels down from Rasta and reluctantly allowed him to use her mainframe terminal to converse once more. Celestra lived within a modest pod that extended into the seventh sector. Roughly level with the deep sea floor Rasta thought. “So how’s life with the Hunters?” Celestra asked casually as her console flashed up the message. She was attractive Scorpio woman with almond eyes. Her gray hair was dyed pink and her body augmented by bionic limbs. Rasta could see her manufacturer model tattooed on her shoulder blade. They often used to muse about a career in porn, fantasizing about the kind of adventures they would have with meager resources. She had grown out of that but he thought that fantasy would never die. In that way Rasta and Celestra were very much alike. They had talked about starting a family but neither of them had the means to start a family. Life with the Hunters didn’t pay as well as it used to, the depletion of the frontier markets had stunted any major benefits of military action. They were on a parallel career path and even though they were both equipped with augmentations they were both taking the downward spiral into middle age when the fecundity window closed. “We have been tasked with clearing another settlement...or what’s left of it. Extinct this time, lacking the Fertility conditions that allowed them to counter the Curse.” _Hunters are ordered to use deadly force, to OPTIMISED-02:5:…_ “Yeah just like always, plus job referrals from UNI-Bs are pretty thin on the ground. Well I hear that Max has set up shop, lots of jobs for augmentations right now I hear.” emptied...still no cure...FUNCTION-STOP:2:3:4:1:HOME:UNIVERSAL-01:3:2:...UNIFY FUNCTIONS... “See you around Echo, till then stay calm and functional…” After updating his status Rasta logged off and left the ad-hoc recovery wing of the hospital.

Dranosh Kull was pissed. Things had happened during his slumber and he felt threatened. His dreams had been filled with images of death and pain. Images that he recognized all too well. He thought, as the AI told him that there was another intruder in the habitat, that this might be the start of one of those more detailed dreams. When the AI informed him that the intruder was the same girl from the other day he had decided his time was better filled by confronting the slight more directly. He couldn't shake the feeling that his dreams foretold his own demise and this strange girl might be the harbinger of that looming death. Auxiliary levels were always cold and dark, for humans anyway. They required less light and the heat was more easily managed by the AIs and AGY sys-
Drash's hands danced across the touch sensors as he worked the decontamination protocols. His mask clicked as it sealed and he activated the compressor on his dive suit. His frame was strengthened, slightly, so that he could handle the extra pressure. He supposed the black hooded suit that he wore was something of a concession to the humans who had gotten him into this predicament. The frame should have held up better against the pressure. He had made every attempt to continue as normal but the humans would not let him. They had left Rona to die. Their leaders had begged him to save them from their pursuers only to leave him with her in the avenger. Their difference in gasses meant that he had been susceptible to her singing and yet in the end they had left her to die. If these humans wanted his help they could damn well direct him, or even shoot him in the back. He would not be a part of whatever they wanted. Raucous laughter filled the small compartment from behind Dr Sheppard. He turned around and glared at the two gunmen standing a little way behind him. Vance Junior and Junior Jr had a habit of coming to this section of the habitat and vandalizing the equipment. This usually resulted in Dr Sheppard having to replace something on either a Thomas or a phi level, a time consuming process. According to the time stamp each of them had been here long enough to have messed with some of their equipment. No doubt they were congratulating themselves on a job well done, their escapades beyond the reach of law enforcement. He had made the mistake of allowing Vance Sr and Jr in here because they had evidence of the crimes but the two of them had other

Why were they all dead? Leyla Blaze figured it had to do with the radiation exposure they were experiencing. It was too much for someone without mutagenic abilities to survive unscathed. Dozens upon dozens of level one workers had left the farms to take up work elsewhere in the habitat. There was numerous work places, but she had heard horror stories of people dying near instantly when exposed to the radiation. Now Glinda worked here too, coming and going without telling Leyla where she was going. In truth she didn't tell Leyla much, only that it was a job that paid. Most days Leyla wondered what exactly Glinda was doing that took up so much of her time. She hated the fact that they had moved to the surface world, but she wasn't going to do anything about it. She had given Harold, Glinda's father, her word that she wouldn't leave Esma behind. Leyla considered herself to be a good person, and her self-imposed imprisonment to be a necessary evil to protect her sister. Glinda hadn't taken too well to the news that she wouldn't be able to attend college as her father had promised. She had lost her mother in childbirth along with her twin brother, leaving only Glinda to be Harold's life. He had tried to make it up to her by shoving Esma into her world, but really Leyla wished her father had been more....flexible when it came to allowing his children's happiness. Glinda gave Leyla general updates about what was happening each day, but she never let Leyla know where she was going or why. Just that she would wander off sometime at the end of each day. Leyla was beginning to hate the habitat for that very reason: freedoms were restricted here. Upon reaching the bottom of the lift she noticed that the hanging lights hadn't come on yet. That wasn't normal....wait a minute....The power wasn't on....and dark bolts shot down hard at her from above. As she raised her hands to block the powerful blows she immediately wondered why: a Krawl had attacked, or something like it. Her body collapsed against another, as she felt a heavy impact on her back. Her head banged against the floor, but she didn't feel a thing. Feeling irritated at this, she tried to regain her senses. She slowly began to open her eyes, but couldn't see much at all. What she could see didn't seem to make much sense: she

The pressurized airlock opened with a hiss and the figure stepped out into the corridor. Although Glinda had gone deeper than he'd expected, the figure could barely suppress his satisfaction. Glinda had been so sure of her own abilities, but she hadn't factored how much nitrogen would build up. It was disappointing to lose such an asset, but she couldn't know about his agenda. There was still a chance for Glinda to serve him, although the mission order was carved deeply in his brain. 'Failure is not an option'. The figure contacted his controller. "She's in position. Clean up and find a new body."
Commissioned piece for return of the reaper.
Got this fantastic idea from a friend of mine. I've wanted to create this post-apocalyptic deity for a long time but have never had the chance to, until now. Thank you so much xoKatie for this commission, everything looks perfect.

But that girl wasn’t Glinda, it was the other Surfie that she was watching, hanging on the wall like a scarecrow in the middle of nowhere.

Glinda had taken odd jobs all over the habitat but had resorted to selling herself to make ends meet. She felt so ashamed of what she had done, and never wanted Esma to find out. She cleared all thoughts of her crimes from her head and headed towards the rendezvous. She held her right hand up to the scanner and the airlock opened, admitting her into a lift that would take her down a level. The banging of the compressors as they brought the pressure in the lift even with that of the next level filled her ears. She thought she heard a hissing noise but the compressor was so loud that she couldn’t be sure. She had just reached the next level when she saw a hooded figure standing outside of the airlock. She watched in horror as the figure fiddled with the manual controls. The figure looked straight at her as it pulled sharply on one of the wires. The lift started to fill with water.Glinda had been out in the water before but always in a heated suit. At this depth the water was close to freezing. She felt her leg muscles start to seize as she started to scream. The hooded figure just stared at her, impassive as the water reached her chest.Glinda was shaking uncontrollably as the water started to cover her face. The coldness of the water took her breath away, leaving her silent as the water filled the rest of the lift. The hooded figure waited until Glinda was dead and then drained the lift, leaving the girl slumped against the wall, soaking wet.**
Glinda's lifeless form slid down the wall as her body relaxed with the effects of the lack of oxygen. The stream of bubbles forcing their way up through her body poured from her mouth and nose as her lungs filled with water. As if the water and her body heat could mingle into each, Glinda's body started to smolder, smoke running into the ducts as her body went up in flames. The hooded figure stood for a moment to let the body burn before walking towards a hatch where there was a small shower room where the airlock's requirements were met. The figure threw the latch and turned off the smoke detector, not wanting to be disturbed by the fire alarm.
The figure stripped and stepped into a dry shower, enjoying the warmth of the spray. A small radio within his docking station switched to an open frequency. There was static and a burst of intermittent sound, but then a voice crackled through. ”Mason to Delta P III, we are getting a signal near the bays. Have you got anything?” The radio crackled again and another voice could be heard. “This is Delta P, I’m checking now. May or may not be a body, I can’t be sure. Mason be advised that the station is quiet and you should be on standby. I am going to start a sweep of the bays now to see if I can locate any other signals.” The radio in the shower crackled once more. “I understand Delta P, we will be there shortly. Do you require assistance?” The girl in the shower adjusted the air settings before pulling the lever to drain the shower and step out of the hot spray. Another grating screech filled the vaulted chamber, reducing her, like the other radios, to an ever present hum that she knew would never leave her.
