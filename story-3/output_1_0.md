She thought she heard a hissing noise but the compressor was so loud that she couldn’t be sure. She had just reached the next level when she saw a hooded figure standing outside of the airlock. She watched in horror as the figure fiddled with the manual controls. The figure looked straight at her as it pulled sharply on one of the wires. The lift started to fill with water.Glinda had been out in the water before but always in a heated suit. At this depth the water was close to freezing.

There was a grim-faced Asian man waiting when Glinda climbed out of the 'trover. Zerkon-303 placed a hand on Glinda’s arm as a gesture of condolence. "It appears the Facilitists have finally found a way of penetrating the smuggler's hide out and his obsession with “when it rains, it pours”. I’ve seen many of these compartments. Tearing the covering off the walls I found recyclers slick with blood and signs of corpses being dragged away. The stench of death lingers heavily around this place. Little wonder the people are deserting it in droves."
Suspects were questioned and rooms were searched in order to tie up any loose ends. Boxes of evidence were held ready for transport to Xai’atek’s underground oceans in the hope that zooplankton would be able to provide DNA on the two dead victims, both of whom were showing all the signs of being a Surfie; one of them being Glinda-469.
The green of the oceans couldn’t be felt through the lid of the box, but if it could it would have reflected the colour of the female solponista who finally recovered some evidence from the washed out body of the dead Surfie. The DNA pointed to the girl being a Surfie and the family that the EU president didn't dare mess with. For the first time he knew he’d reached out further than he should. Warships were massing in orbit over the southern tip of the Americas and he could see the line drawn across the Panama Sea. His limited vision showed three Conchian warships in orbit above America, Concha being the country the EU Diplomatic Corps could use to invade America without starting a war. 
There was a chance he could get something from the printouts, although not much. They could still hold fingerprints. The twin galaxies of Orion had been folding up their maps of the human space for millennia, although the colour of the ocean at the colony could be tracked. It would make perfect sense not to be covered in the standard Sci-fi Cala blue, the sea here was a calm cyan green as it deepened, greeting the raft with the welcome kindness of the sun.
The woman who ran the Printouts shop as she preferred to call it (her husband pretended not to understand the phrase 'name your own price”) surveyed his measurements and prices with a gaze that seemed

Supply Technician, Thomas Richards didn’t know why he had done it. He stood up and pulled off his cloak so that he was standing in his coveralls. He quickly screwed the lights back into their sockets and raced back towards the airlock that the mole people called their home. He held up his hand to the scanner and waited for the airlock to open. Sealing the door behind him he quickly pressed the blue glowing button. The pumps hummed as air was drawn back into the Level. The inner door slid quickly upwards, so he could enter the Level. He walked briskly along the corridor towards the Management department and reclaimed his cloak. The wire he had placed had short circuited the loading bay doors. He sighed and made his way towards the tunnel. All he wanted was to get back to his family, he had been missing them a lot.
T he small flesher stared around in wonder. The Underwater had been a constant roar in its ears, and now there was a silence so encompassing that it almost hurt physically. The sound of its own heartbeat reverberating back to it was deafening and it started to whine. Dosule half heard the creature and he idly offered up a prayer to the Creator for its reaction was universal to all flesh species, though he imagined as the creature could not talk, the feeling would be of being alone on an alien world. He paid the creature less mind than even the Primes he labored over. The Creator had not yet mastered the art of communication with things so new to His world. Preservation of species was one thing but Dosule always felt it was the Creator’s way of either interjecting Himself, or his penchant for chaos. The Creator knew that Dosule’s kind would be the only stimulus this new species would have for the next million years. Creative enough to conquer fission in 1.7 million years for their own ends and to wipe the other two sentient species, hominids and Neanderthals off the Earth. Hard headed enough to see how either the German’s or Japanese could take them there in sixty odd years. The Creator had thought of everything if it could be said to have thought of anything. Although it reserved its greatest contempt for the Creator’s only official representatives, itself and the creator progeny. The creator progeny were less creative and far more easily corrupted than his kind. The twin prongs of Evil’s conquest of the Holy world were characteristically 1. Dev

Sydney City Wharf Lord marrow steamed as he saw Gunter, Carl and Sally peering over the edge of the wharf off the corner of his eye. Sally silently brought them to order with a hand signal. Gunter looked as if he was going to make a snide remark but he thought better of it. The wharf was owned by Sydney City Corporation (SCC), which meant they had to play by the Corporation’s rules if they wanted to work this area effectively. Technically speaking he had already exceeded that first rule by approaching the wharf without the right security passes. He motioned for the man who had showed him to the wharf, a grey-haired Italian by the name of Enzo, to bring the whole squad along. Enzo had been hesitant to escort people anywhere on the wharf at all. But he had a stack of work to do on the account and he could hardly say no. There had been rumors going around that SCC was involved with an ultra-secret scientific endeavour. This involved them building a large compound on the wharf, behind tall fences, specially armed guards, and under heavy surveillance. Who were they hiding though? No-one had a clue what SCC were doing but the guards were turning the wharf into their personal little piggy bank. Revenues had fallen off since this project had been commissioned, and officials had been going around the various businesses on the wharf undercover to see how they would cope if this scientific venture forced them out of business. This was especially hard on the wharf restaurants. The business district was the place to be seen, people came here to be seen, the wharf had an impeccable reputation. There was nothing like cars waiting to ferry wealthier clientele to and from nearby Carrington Ruckwood, famous for its decadent restaurants. People dressed to the nines, if they couldn’t afford to dine out they at least experienced the other side of it dutifully every weekend. But since this scientific project got underway the wharf had become painful to look at. Lord marrow stood patiently by as he waited for the rest of his squad to get to the wharf. The rows of shipping containers on either side of the wharf had once provided the backing for several restaurants. These restaurants were known as “fish houses” since most of the cooking was done on boats and they cooked seafood. A major concept behind fish houses was freshness, customers were willing to pay more so that

The Osprey splashed down in the Astroflores River. Alex strapped on his fins and kicked away from the ship. The white board was easy to see amidst the shapes of the Riptide crab beneath the water. He swam to grab the marker board, and pulled it back to the ship. Alex had been hoping that the ship would have been reported to it as stolen or maybe recovered by the guard. Unfortunately Alex had used a false ID to rent the vessel. He had readjusted his plans after sniffing out both the Osprey when it docked and the Navy guard. Now he needed to finish the job so he could take off the ADP patch and be off to the unexplored parts of the ocean. Those parts that people would pay through their nose to reach. Those parts were called the Depths.
Alex swam to the dive ladder that snaked along the Osprey from the top deck to down under the surface. Further under than any diver had been known to pass. The thick rudder that the Osprey was controlled with reached deep down into the depths, where no diver could go, only the monstrous creatures that lived there. It would be an easy matter to screw up the rudder so that it jammed in place. Alex had done that with the backup on the other side of the town, stopping the ship, and condemning the passengers to their fate. All he needed to do was go home, finish making some modifications to one of his tighter scubs, and get to the rendezvous tomorrow. “We’re stuck!” a girl with tousled black hair shouted as soon as Alex stepped onto the boat. “And I know why, I should have bloody known…” she added. Alex just shrugged and scrambled up to the top. The Osprey rocked as a girl hefted herself from the swim step. “Everyone OK?” she asked. “Yes” one of the passengers answered. “You didn't answer Lucy, what's wrong?” a thickset man asked. “There’s only one of them, there were supposed to be two.” The girl on the swim step shook her head. “Was it just that scoundrel at the gate? How did he change shifts? Wait…” Alex looked up. “… did you chase him into the water? Did you hurt him Alex?” Lucy stared at the diver.

Level Ten Water raised her hand in front of her face but didn't bother to pinch her cheeks to make them red. They didn't like the dying then did they. She looked to her side and saw she had a page. It wasn't really a page as such, just a vidscreen showing the face of James the Butlers Johnston’s, the ambassador for Delta P. She knew this even though she had no eyes for Ivo would have told her. “James, now is not a good time.” Water waved her hand and the image on the vidscreen shifted until she could clearly view her ancestor Roth Williams. Something told her that Ivo had placed Roth here for this very occassion. “I find it interesting that you have placed a mummy in my stateroom when I’m about to re-enter the world above. You knew it may frighten me, which is why you’ve done this?” “A simple yes or no will do Ivo,” Water smiled as she coiled in her seat “I’ll be depending on your spectacular performance of course.” “I trust in your judgement Water now go to James or I will presume you are distracted and not about to embark on what promises to be a great, great adventure. Water was about to wave her hand again when she felt a presence behind her. She wrapped her hand around the tiny finger blasting rod Ivo had placed in her pocket. “I mean hope a performance of the highest order.” she then waved her hand at the screen and James’s vidscreen went blank. Roth opened his mouth and made as if to speak but Water pulled her blaster from her pocket and pointed it at him pointing “Do make sure Ivo comes study my mummy, or...” she wriggled the blasters finger alongside her temple. Ivo's biological form walked out of the toilet and into the shower room. Water's tiny companion closed the bathroom door behind it and moved up to Ivo. The smaller person gently put their hand on the bigger one's shoulder and Ivo fell to one knee. The companion spoke in a whispered message only she could hear “Water Ghost says to take to know if that slut Mary will hath come wet upon thy cock.” Ivo slowly stood up from their kneeling position, his ears red with embarrassment. The companion placed their hand on Ivo's forearm's and spoke “

The figure carefully pulled aside the front of his hood as he walked down the corridor. The bright lights in this part of Delta P had blinded Glinda. They were much less intense here. The colors were muted and everything seemed to be shrouded in fog. The figure entered a room and then quietly shut the door. A console sitting by the far wall with a young looking man sitting in front of it. A few of the boards had lost their fluid and the main screen had a crack in it but it still worked. Harris Chad, judged by everything he was wearing, didn“t belong here. But it didn“t matter to Glennis, she was dead thanks to him. He smiled as the figure walked over to the console. “You had the look of a girl who liked the company of fried fish.” “That bay hoo caused me a lot of trouble, but not as much as anyone else would have got.” The figure was wearing a Chinese tsunade fish mask and had Chinese written on its collar. Harris started looking through the information on the bio of the ninja he had just elminated. “Google? You have all the stuff on that bitch”s bio.” He chuckled as he reached out for the chopsticks next to the girl“s body. He took out the memory sticks he had given Glennis. He didn“t imagine a “Fish Farm girl” would be that hard but he had had a scrap with the girl before drowning her. He looked over at Google. Maybe she did have some fight in her. He tossed the sticks to an indistinct shape hiding in the fog. Taking off his cloak he threw on a t-shirt and walked over to leave by the other door. The figure opened up the sticks and loaded the data into a computer. Downloading the data the figure activated the taps and started to fill the room with water.

Glinda had taken odd jobs all over the habitat but had resorted to selling herself to make ends meet. She felt so ashamed of what she had done, and never wanted Esma to find out. She cleared all thoughts of her crimes from her head and headed towards the rendezvous. She held her right hand up to the scanner and the airlock opened, admitting her into a lift that would take her down a level. The banging of the compressors as they brought the pressure in the lift even with that of the next level filled her ears. She thought she heard a hissing noise but the compressor was so loud that she couldn’t be sure. She had just reached the next level when she saw a hooded figure standing outside of the airlock. She watched in horror as the figure fiddled with the manual controls. The figure looked straight at her as it pulled sharply on one of the wires. The lift started to fill with water.Glinda had been out in the water before but always in a heated suit. At this depth the water was close to freezing. She felt her leg muscles start to seize as she started to scream. The hooded figure just stared at her, impassive as the water reached her chest.Glinda was shaking uncontrollably as the water started to cover her face. The coldness of the water took her breath away, leaving her silent as the water filled the rest of the lift. The hooded figure waited until Glinda was dead and then drained the lift, leaving the girl slumped against the wall, soaking wet.**

**There was the steady drip of water that always seemed to accompany life in the habitat. Glinda had received a note that someone who “knew too much” wanted to meet her or would reveal her secret. Glinda jumped as she heard the sound of metal on metal, a scraping sound that wrenched the ears. Her head snapped towards that sound.She laughed a little as a small crab scuttled across the corridor. Growing up on the surface Glinda had yet to get used to the differences between the Delta P habitat and the surface world. She remembered being fascinated by the habitat when they had first arrived. Right now she wished they were still back home in Iowa. That they hadn’t left the world she knew to pursue a dream, that she now realized was a false dream. Her father had brought them here so that he could work in the kelp farms, but shortly after arriving he had suffered from a decompression accident. After his death all Glinda wanted was to feel the sun warming her skin, as she closed her eyes against its brightness. There was no brightness here. Just the constant oppressing darkness that was cut occasionally by the overhead lights. She got used to the cold, the damp and the noise; but she couldn't get over the lack of decent light.

1 - DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS
Same Time, Surface World
The smell of her cinnamon coffee first hit Ianto as he opened his eyes. It was the same smell that he had associated with Jack for a long time. It brought back memories of that first day, all those years ago when Jack had turned up at Torchwood in Cardiff, breathing heavily and looking rougher behind the eyes than a 1940's ad exec. The smell drew him out of bed. He looked over at Captain Jack Harkness, standing by the table where the plunger sat, almost at attention. Ianto smiled, never more aware of how lucky he had been when he had gone out to the Blacksmiths Arms to hear y Llwyd's performance that night all those years ago. When he had caught sight of this man at the show. Jack recalled the open hearted humor of y Llyw and his tales of a place he called the Thirty Glorious. He didn't expect y Llwyd to lend this tall man any credence. After all what sort of place would be called the Thirty Glorious? Stain Glas? Ianto thought he was having a wee bit of breakfast with y Llwyd the next morning before he headed over to Jack's place. It was just that his friend had allowed his more salacious side a temporary release. He was laughing as he remembered the story about the stallion called Radclyffe overcompensating because he had a small...Panto! Well Jack hitched up his trousers and promptly planted a fist so hard into y Llwyd's mouth that all Ianto found behind stage was blood, teeth, and a set of very nice curtains. It wasn't that Jack was ashamed of what he did, he just didn't want people to know what he was. Ianto held him as he wept, wishing that he hadn't been at the bar that night rather than sitting at Burrendah chatting to Nasinar. And he meant that. He would happily abandon everything that he had to spend the last three decades with this man. As long as Jack felt the same. “TEA IS MADE!” Jack exclaimed, snapping Ianto back to the now. The sound of his voice startled Ianto back to the present. “And thousands are saying oh yes please, make mine a double.” Ianto's smile turned to a frown. “What was that song, Jack? Its bloody knocking my pedals. Oh you are such

Glinda started to smell the marshy scent of the Delta P habitat. She was proud of the way she was looking after Esma without have to resort to selling herself. Glinda put on her best fake smile as she listened to Esma chatter away about the latest movie that was a hit with the Surfies. She rubbed the top of Esma’s head. ”Hey look who’s here!” said Chip. Chip had been Esma’s boyfriend before their dad died and was the best friend Glinda had. “How was the big game Forsythe?” He came over and kissed Glinda on the forehead, taking the pressure out of the situation. He turned to Esma and signed, “I got some extra credits. Why don’t we go into town and get us some food, huh?”  F o r s y t h e‌ was the leader of the Surfies and like most well connected people in Delta P he got Esma into the Habitat School of Eastern Iowa Arts and Letters (HSEL for short). Forsythe always had a reputation as the playboy and was well respected when he wanted to be respected. Glindas thoughts of the past quickly disappeared and she remembered that Esma had been driven like crazy to join Forsythe and the other Surfies when she got back from this party. Everyone always mentioned that Forsythe was surrounded by girls so he looked well off for money. Forsythe hung over Esma like a bad smell, interrupting the innocent conversation. “Feeling lonely now, huh babe?” Esma just shook her head, knowing that the club was watching the movement of her eyes. Her face was blank as she started signing furiously. “Shush Baby. We’ll talk later,” she said in signing. Forsythe leered at Esma so much that it unsettled Glinda. Suddenly Esma’s face lit up and she gave Forsythe a big kiss on the cheek. He said, “That’s my girl. Now come on and let me show you my “hood”,” with a smirk, and also measuring up Esma’ head with his hands. Esma nodded and said, “Can’t wait but I got a challenge fight coming up. I told Chip and you.” “Have your fight. I
