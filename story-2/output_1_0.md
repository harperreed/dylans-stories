**Octavia took a deep breath and opened her eyes. The class was still there. She had hoped that somehow closing her eyes would have made them go away. Her eyes darted around the room and saw Mrs. Roger’s smile at her, encouraging her to start her talk.**

**It was the first day of 6th grade and, as was usual at the start of a new school year, they were being forced to talk about what they did over their summer vacation. That was the last thing she wanted to talk about. Sumer had sucked.**

**Her parents had finally gotten a divorce. Which meant no more yelling at each other, not more silent dinners, and no more family. Her best friend, Steve, had tried to make her feel better by telling her she would have two Christmases, but that didn’t help.**

But then Steve stopped calling. Ryan had already stopped calling. It was just him, and her, alone against the world. And it sucked.

This new school with its new kids, and its promise of a new start, was the only thing that had made her look forward to this year. This school was supposed to be better. Now it was going to suck too.

She shivered as every eye in the class turned to look at her. She didn’t think she could do this. She closed her eyes for one more attempt to escape.

“Juliette?” called Mrs. Roger. “Are you okay? Do you need another minute to prepare?”

Octavia thought for a minute, and closed her eyes. For a second thinking the pressure on her chest was actually subsiding, then came the sudden realization that everyone was still staring at her. “No, I’m—I’m ready.”

“Alright then,” said Mrs. Roger, checking her phone. “How about you start us off with a beginning sentence, and then each sentence after that should tell a piece of the whole story.”

Everything had been so awful that she had secretly hoped something would happen to her so she wouldn’t have to go to school again. She had a breakdown a couple days before the start of school, saying she wanted to die, and her parents had taken her to the psychiatrist.



In addition to the whole family thing, it just hadn’t rained the whole summer and the air had been humid, making her hair frizz up. All the hot weather had made her allergies worse, and because of that, the touching thing had started.



The touching thing had started because of her frizzy hair and her allergies. She had explained to her mom that her scalp got really itchy. 

She tried to be careful not to scratch her head in public because of what people would think, but her hair was driving her crazy and she always ended up touching it anyway. Her mom suggested they buy some jogging type headbands to wear under her hair, so it would stay up off the back of her neck where the itching was worst.

But somehow, after that, she and her mom had started touching each other’s foreheads too, and when other people saw them doing it, they looked really strange. So, they stopped. 

She had given up eating lunch too. She brought a toothbrush and mints to school with her and brushed right in the bathroom each day. Her mom made her that lunch.



Try as she might, she couldn’t get her hair to lie flat and it looked like she always had this frizz around her head. She wished it would light on fire, but there wasn’t anything. There was no fire.



Finishing her sentence about summer vacation, she quickly moved back to her seat beside the aisle. The chair from which she usually sat was gone. It had been removed, and others were being rearranged. Where once her row had been 9, 10, 11, 12, (her), and 13, the rows had been changed to 12, 13, 10, 11, 12, 13. 

Years ago her class projector had been broken when a kid passed out one morning because he ate one too many cafeteria donuts. When some of the kids threw up on him, it got worse, and it was his sudden movement to get up to throw up that triggered the projector release and dropped it on the student’s head, denting it irreparably. It hadn’t been

Whatever. Once in a while, she had almost wished that something tragic would happen to her family, just so she would have some sympathy. 

But it hadn’t come. And now, here she was, standing in class alone with nothing to talk about, for the whole entire class to hear. Her palms were sweating and her hands still felt like ghost hands. 

How many times had she imagined her forthcoming classmates? This class was the sixth class she had been in. Would her classmates be typical cliché kids? Would there be class clowns? Would there be the popular people, the goths, the nerds? Would people actually pay attention to what she was saying? 

“My summer vacation was a blast. Summers are just great in general. It’s hard to think of how much fun you can have with nothing to do. There is nothing more than Mom’s cooking and Neil’s clean clothes that I need! It was a hard time for my whole family – Becca and Lloyd got married and it took a lot of thought to go through with it. Our family was torn apart and broken to pieces, but, through it all, it was definitely a blast,” June finished. The class stared at her with blank faces. Even Mrs. Roger had no smile plastered on her face. 

The innocent June smiled and kept talking. She was that girl, the girl who overcame odds. “Yes, back in March, Becca, my oldest sister, a single woman, gave birth to a child. A boy. She and Lloyd were going to name him ‘Albert,’ but they changed their mind and left the last name blank for lack of a better idea. What can I say, the birth made my family so jealous and mad. But, Becca never seemed bothered and wasn’t panicking. Even with the baby, she only moans that her back is aching and not sharp words that are meant to hurt. I have to admit that I didn’t think she would be so tough, but she proved me wrong! All the members of my family tried to help her. We pitched in to help her for the birthday that the baby never had. We all had a big party. And, hooray, we were finally a family again!” 

June kept talking, not really knowing what she was talking about. “At school, we spent most of the time settling into our school

Yet worse than that was that her mother had taken a job at a wealthy man’s horse ranch.

Overtime, this man, Ernest MacFarland, had talked her into moving to his ranch outside Las Vegas. Her mom could work a split shift at the Strip late at night and still get up in time to feed the horses and take care of the rambunctious, but adorable, puppies at MacFarland’s ranch. Plus she got to see amazing creatures, distance runners. There was only one problem with living at that ranch. MacFarland used to run that ranch with his two sons. But the oldest, Buck, joined the military, leaving Brent all alone to run it.

But Brent had turned out to be some kind of total psycho who tried to date fourteen-year-old Octavia, who almost became his fifth wife at his last Vegas wedding. 

Her eyes scanned the room, looking for someone, anyone who didn’t make her feel so small so her mind could get off MacFarland and Brent and steer onto something else. Unfortunately her eyes passed by Steve without even double-taking, which was weird, because Steve was usually the first person she’d look for.

The only person in the classroom she didn’t want to look at was Brent, and he was sitting beside her, wagged his eyebrows at her, taunting her. She knew Steve would protect her from him, so long as he wasn’t distracted. 

Maybe a change of subject would help her feel better. So, change of subject it is. 

“My summer,” Octavia spoke but she couldn’t remember the rest of it, so she panicked. Her heart thumping in her ears. 

She turned around in her seat to her backpack to get the things she needed for her presentation. But she couldn’t because Brent was blocking her, so she whacked him with her elbow. “Out of the way, Brent.” His eyes widened and he took a step back. 

Good. Now she just needed to get her microphone out of her bag, and-

But she needed her bag. 

Octavia stood up quickly, but tripped over her backpack and Brent calling at her to wait for him shouted too. They were both on the ground, and she had hit her head on the floor. She heard angry shouts in her ears and felt the sting of tears

Patches of grass have begun to push their way through the tar roof. The few solitary roots leading down the walls are now a carpet of green that manages to keep its fragile hold even while passing through the destruction. The tumble of rocks in the middle has been slowly sinking into the tar until it is almost completely covered. There are small piles of branches surrounding the building

Every function of the planet will soon be coming to a halt. As the cynicism trickles from lack of use, nature and industry will both seep into the ground. Either the water or the pollutants will break through the thin surface, blanket the remains, and claim for them their final place.

The bitterness had started as small pimples in the corner of his mouth. He could have ignored them if he wanted. After all, there was always the mirror to cheat by. But he couldn’t lie to his mother. Somehow she always knew. Before he knew it, he was crying, and himself was a distant memory.

The man builds cages of words and scraps of wire that he calls pleasure. The bars fall away and carry him with them. These words are like no one’s who has been born before. They are like no one born again. The mud which purifies them is not fatal like the Sun.

Looking at her now, one would never suspect the horror hidden beneath her checkered pink and black skirt. Should she ever begin to walk backwards, all her carefully sealed secrets would begin to thin from her pores.



After renting an apartment in the dark and dreary town of Elm Street, Dreamer tries to make it happen, even though she keeps the sun from sinking into the depths below and trees from growing up into the blank sky. One day, her neighbors notice something unusual, but Dreamer just doesn’t care anymore. Hands become stained with tar as it falls from above. Each night, the black substance seeps through the roots of her hands towards the surface.



Hours later, blood creeps into twilight, as the last creature touches the branches which are shiny and young. The blockade will be completed. When the last embers are taken underground, darkness will pour onto the tar and will, in turn, sate the thirsts of the

In her report, she blabbered on about what she did over the summer as her eyes roamed the back of the room where Steve was sitting. She made it sound as if she had had a brilliant summer and hadn’t even noticed that she hadn’t answered the question. The whole time as she was blabbering on she was waiting for Steve to offer her his smile, like he always did in the old days, anytime she told him one of her stories. He had called the insurance company on her and her parents’ car to make sure the insurance money would be enough to buy a new one. He had promised her a cake and the party the first night she came back. He had promised the hope and the happiness.

All she registered was the fact that it wasn’t enough.

Her eyes found another boy’s face in the room. He was handsome, and there was sadness in his eyes. Deep down in her soul, she missed snarky, kind Steve. But she had wished on the throwing star every day and it did not change the situation. Now she was standing on the stage.

They were going to break up. It was as inevitable as the death of the stars.

The next day at lunch, Steve leaned across the table so no one else could hear what he was about to say. It had taken twenty five minutes for him to come up with what he considered to be the perfect plan.

“So I’m going to throw a party.”

Alyssa snorted. “How desperate can you get?”

Steve looked at her indignantly. “I’m not desperate. We need a farewell party for you whether or not you are leaving. Monty tried to warn me, but I don’t believe in psychic piglets.”

“ Where are you planning on having your party?” I asked tentatively.

“At your place.”

“Are you joking? My parents? They aren’t exactly the partying type. You want to throw a party at the house where the adults will be asleep upstairs? They’ll come flying down and ruin it.”

“You’re leaving tomorrow. I’m surprised you care.”

I wrinkled my nose at him. “I do not want my parents to wake up and ruin our party. I’

**Her parents had finally gotten a divorce. Which meant no more yelling at each other, not more silent dinners, and no more family. Her best friend, Steve, had tried to make her feel better by telling her she would have two Christmases, but that didn’t help.**

She thought about her swim club, but she wasn’t supposed to do any debut fishing for another two years, and besides, Caroline, her coach, had a family and didn’t have time for her anymore. Her school, whether she was ready for it or not, was a fact of her life she was just destined to deal with. 

She felt her cheeks getting warm and she could hear her heart beating, loudly and fast. She swallowed past her dry throat. 

Why was she standing in front of the class trying to talk about something they could just as easily read in her boring book? How could she make them see the hot drippy smoldering crackle and pang of the sky burning orange and spinning around her? She couldn’t. That didn’t stop her from trying. Using her hands to illustrate, she said:

December never had been her favorite month and she couldn’t help herself from being a tad unpleasant with her sister Eleanor, who had moved back in with the family for Christmas break. She told her to stick her singing in the car. “This is my time! I’m going to spend all that time in the garden with Dad! I was helping him repot the begonias and Swedish ivy!”

With a speed that cats would envy, Eleanor scooped up the jingle bell tree she had just hung under the tree with a star that said, ‘Welcome’. She dashed into the house. A ’56 Montgomery Ward’s catalog for Christmas! A surprise gift for my presentation! Go away!’, she yelled over her shoulder.

With her heart aching Octavia stormed off the porch and watched as her sister ran down the porch and dashed across the lawn to the mortified guests. With a slash of her arm she whiped the farm stand and live herb and vegetable garden. Octavia opened her mouth to say something, but her father looked at her with such unconditional love that she fell silent. That had been the best Christmas.

It’s not fair. All I wanted was to be better than Eleanor, and now I am and look at me.’

She kicked at a stone; scraping her black toe nail. Part of it peeled off, leaving a strip of raw red flesh. She lowered her shoe and examined her toe nail and realized she hadn’t been balanced on her right foot and she nearly fell. She hobbled over

As luck would have it, one of the boys sitting in front of her had been badgering her to tell him what she did all summer. Finding a way out of the conversation, she started her talk by saying, “I read a book. A pretty good one. It’s called The Time Traveler’s Wife.”

She saw her teacher, getting angry. It was a perfect example of the perfect summer. The teacher scolded her, the sound she’d been assaulted with all the summer, loud enough for all to hear. The rest of the school day was spent with teachers, like her 6th grade English teacher, Mr. Matthiven, asking her if she’d read a book lately.

Ridicule being her usual response to sarcasm, she had the unfortunate tendency to verbally shred those who were sarcastic towards her. Smiling, she continued, “Yeah. It’s about a man who is going through a divorce. So his time traveling abilities allow him to meet with his ex-wife and his wife at the same point in time. Such an awesome story, with these three-hour monthly love reunions. I warned you: tears and puppies were involved.” 

The class was momentarily stunned, and stopped whispering. A small group of girls appeared to be offended. 

“I thought the story was really good. The ending, however, gave me a little issue of truth.” They were not back to whispering among themselves, but most of them didn’t make eye contact. Once again her teacher, Ms. Morgun, came to her rescue by introducing her friend and admirer Blake to continue talking. 

Grabbing her pencil off her desk, Topia began to draw Steve. It was his smile. It was her life line. She had saved his number on her cell phone, and now she was going to take his photo using a Polaroid camera. 

Telling everybody her project, she grabbed all of her friends to join her in her little photo shoot, taking pictures of each other. She had planned on ordering a custom magnet board for her bedroom, baby floor to ceiling magnets of her favorite photos. In a way, it was like her nails. Not only did it give her something to do, but she could sit there and immerse herself into her story. At the time, the project gave her an escape… a place to pretend that she’d

Still, she had her favorite teachers, Octavia thought as she saw Mrs. Rogers smile at her and Mr. Rembridge, her math teacher, stand up and clap. He was a tall, bald man who always wore a sweat stained t-shirt and a Lakers hat. Octavia always thought he looked more like a laborer that a teacher but he knew his stuff. He smiled at her and she felt herself smile in return.

Octavia was not the kind to let out people know she felt depressed or anything else for that matter. She hoped that they just thought she was an awkward 14-year-old girl that liked classic literature more than the average person. However, she believed they saw through her. As a girl who was constantly told she sometimes read too much, wrote too much, and that she was too quiet to be truly normal, Octavia felt that people could see that every time she listened to music, she was able to see things that made her want to cry or feel paranoid or feel too much.

The class, now in full laughter, began to calm down as Na’omi, Octavia’s dim-witted and large crosseyed outcast friend began to recount how she and her family had loaded the car in the morning and spent the whole day driving to their new home. Her family had moved often as she was growing up, which made her just as flippant about them loading up the car and moving to a new place as Octavia was distressed about it.

Mrs. Rogers turned her back towards the class which usually meant she needed a minute to collect her thoughts. Mrs. Rogers was in her late thirties, originally from Nebraska, which surprisingly was one of the many places that Octavia’s family had lived. One of the many woes of having a divorce in a military-based family.

Octavia picked up her rubber band from her desk and began to shoot it at the type-written words on her whiteboard. The whiteboard was positioned directly behind her desk and was used to display class thoughts. It was old and dinged, as they all were. They had too many whiteboards for too small of a class size. Of course, it would have easily been too small of a class size if not for the intervention of Na'omi. Her classmate’s large size caused most of the other students to be frightened of her or to become bullying types.

Mrs. Rogers turned her attention back to the wide

Mr. and Mrs. Wire, the wire brush people from the science fair, had told her she could keep her petri-dish if she wanted. They rarely saw her anymore.

She had time for all of two weeks of fun with her mothers and Steve before she was made to move into her father’s new, made-for-teens house where no one was allowed in unless it was Sunday, which was his day off. During the week he had lots of cop friends over... like everyday, so it was hard to hang out even if you were there.

What was she supposed to say? “Well, over summer vacation I was taken in by this really cool family of wire brush people who raised me very well. In a way, this was a nice change, if anything, from before when no one was a bother to me, but I got bored. This was nice since I was being taken care of, and my food - mynew parents were kinda creepy since their bristles wore down along with their faces – didn’t change. All I had to do was block it all out with my iPod whenever I couldn’t take it anymore. But, It was kind of boring, I would wake up and the kitchen floor would be full of brushing dust, or the sink or bath tub full, and I’d clean it up before I went to school. I had trouble keeping a petri-dish alive, since I just had to make sure that I kept the glass covered... although I could take it over to my friend, Steve’s house where he could look out for it and fight off martians ... well, at least till I got car sick on the school bus the last week of summer.”

She sighed and tried to keep her stomach from rolling and her eyes from tearing up. She really had a pretty boring summer vacation like she was talking about. The only thing interesting about it was that Steve got her invited to his camp-out to fight the martians. 

June had tried to keep her spirits up, but it had been hard. Being adopted, she wasn’t used to things like this. She prayed that her adoption papers would change, because she couldn’t believe that her mother and fathers would do that to her. She would even read stories about other foster kids on the internet, kids who got adopted later in their lives and how lucky they were because everything turned out all right, at least in
