Octavia stared at the wall, unable to move or talk. She was going to be sent to the principal’s office. She knew it.
Octavia’s head whipped around and she saw her classmates were looking at her. 
Her eyes began to water and she looked at Mrs. Roger, pleading with her eyes.
Mrs. Roger walked over to Octavia and placed a hand on her shoulder.
Octavia tried to hold back her tears, but they spilled over. She was glad it was a small classroom. No one could see her cry.
Octavia was surprised when Mrs. Roger walked back to her desk and wrote something on a piece of paper. She then walked back to Octavia and handed her the paper.
Octavia looked at the paper. It said “I know it’s hard, but you can do it.” 
Octavia looked up and saw Mrs. Roger smile at her. 
She took a deep breath and began to speak.

They were so excited when her parents announced that they were finally getting a divorce. They were excited about being able to choose which parent they wanted to live with.
They were really excited when their parents told them they were going to be living with their father. But then the day before school started, they were told that they were going to be living with their mother.
When they had gotten to their mother’s house, she told them that they were going to have to share a room, which was fine with them.
They had gotten into their new room and noticed a girl sitting on the floor in the corner. She had a black eye and was shaking. They thought she was a friend of their mother’s, but then their mother told them that she was their new sister.

She told them that their father had left her for another woman. And that the girl was the other woman’s daughter. And that the other woman was a bitch. And that the other woman’s daughter was a bitch, too. And that they were not to talk to the other woman’s daughter. And that they were to be nice to the other woman’s daughter. And that the other woman was a whore. And that they were to be nice to the other woman, too. And that the other woman’s daughter was also a whore.

She couldn’t even tell Steve about it, because he was moving. To Chicago. 
She took a deep breath and started. “I went to Disney World with my family.”
The kids laughed. She blushed. 
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to laugh,” the boy next to her said. “It’s just that you are the only person in this room who didn’t spend their summer vacation in Disney World.”
“I know,” she said, “It’s just that my parents were getting a divorce and I didn’t want to go.”
“So, what did you do?” the boy asked.
“Well, we had to get out of the house. My dad rented a houseboat and we went on a three week cruise down the Mississippi.”
“That sounds really cool,” the boy said.
“It was,” she said, “but I missed my best friend.”
“Why didn’t he go with you?” the boy asked.
“He was moving to Chicago,” she said.
“That’s a bummer,” the boy said.
“I know,” she said, “But I have you now.”
“Yeah,” the boy said. “I guess so.”
Octavia smiled at him. 
“So, what’s your name?” he asked.
“Octavia,” she said.
“That’s a cool name,” he said. “My name is Bruce.”
“Hi Bruce,” she said.
“Hi Octavia,” he said.
The two of them sat in silence for the rest of the class. Octavia knew that she would remember that day forever. She would never forget the day she met Bruce.
She could hear Bruce in the other room, playing with his trains. He had been playing with them for a long time. It was almost dinner time. She went into the room and sat down on the floor next to him.
“Hi Bruce,” she said.
“Hi Octavia,” he said

She looked down at her speech. The paper was filled with boxes, arrows, and little circles, which made it look like the Periodic Table. The only thing written on it was the title of her talk: “What I Did Over My Summer Vacation.”

She opened her mouth to speak, but then she stopped. A thought had just occurred to her. It wasn’t summer vacation anymore. She didn’t have to talk about that anymore. She could say anything she wanted. She didn’t have to be held to the past. She could start over.

She cleared her throat and said, “Hi. My name is Octavia Smith. I’m going to be in sixth grade at Ravenwood Middle School this year. I’m really excited about it. I can’t wait to see what new things I’ll learn and meet new people. I’m also excited to be able to hang out with my best friend, Steve. I know that we’ll have a great year. I can’t wait. I’m really looking forward to it. I’m going to miss my old school, but I’m also really excited about my new school. I think it’s going to be a great year.”

She stopped and looked up. She hadn’t realized she was crying. Her eyes felt wet. She looked up at Mrs. Roger. Her teacher was smiling at her.

Octavia smiled back.

***

Octavia walked out of the building. The last bell had rung ten minutes ago, and now she was standing outside. She had nowhere to go. She felt like she should go home, but she wasn’t sure where that was anymore. Her parents had gotten a divorce and she was living with her mother now. She didn’t know where her father was.

She started walking. She walked down the sidewalk, her feet kicking up small puffs of dirt as she went. She had on new shoes. She had bought them herself. She hadn’t bought them to wear to school, though. She had bought them for school, but they weren’t for school. She had bought them to walk home in.

She had never walked home from school before. She had always ridden the bus, but today she had missed the bus. She didn

This year she was supposed to have a better summer. Her parents had told her they had signed her up for a special summer camp. It was supposed to be a new kind of camp where you learned about the stars and the planets. Her parents said that was important because when she grew up she would want to be an astronaut. They said she would learn about math and science and space and that would be really good for her.
It had sounded really cool. But then they told her it was a girls’ camp and she would be the only girl there. It wasn’t as much fun anymore.
And then she got there. The camp was in the middle of the woods. There were only girls there. They were all older than her. And there were no counselors. No adults. Just the girls. The girls said they didn’t need any adults because they were all responsible girls.
Then she found out what the camp was really about.
They said it was a camp to teach girls how to be powerful. That was a cool word, powerful. It meant you could do whatever you wanted to do. It meant you were in charge of yourself and no one could tell you what to do.
The first thing they did was to take her away from the other girls and make her sit on a log in the woods. And then they told her to take off her clothes.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because you have to learn to be comfortable being naked,” one of the girls said. “It’s part of being powerful.”
She didn’t like it, but she was afraid of being left alone in the woods, so she took off her clothes.
“That’s good,” the girl said. “Now put your hands on your head and turn around three times.”
Octavia did as she was told.
“Good,” the girl said. “Now touch your toes.”
She bent down to touch her toes.
“Good,” the girl said. “Now, can you do it without looking?”
Octavia had no idea what the girl was talking about, but she didn’t want to look stupid in front of the other girls, so she said, “I think so.”
“Good,” the girl said. “Now, do it

It was even worse when he moved to a different school district in September. And then her dog died. It was a pretty crappy summer. 
“I had the best summer ever,” a voice from the front of the class broke into her thoughts.

“I went to Disney World with my parents,” another voice chimed in.

“I went to camp,” yet another voice added.

“I went to the beach,” someone else said.

Octavia looked around the room and saw all the happy faces.

Everyone in the class was telling about how great their summer had been. Everyone but her.

The kids around her were starting to notice that she wasn’t talking.

They were looking at her and whispering to each other. They were all happy, but she was miserable.

“Okay,” Mrs. Roger said. “It’s time to sit down. Octavia, why don’t you come up here and tell us about your summer?”

Octavia shook her head.

“No,” she said.

“Come on,” Mrs. Roger said. “Don’t be shy.”

“I’m not shy,” Octavia said. “I just don’t want to.”

Mrs. Roger sighed.

“Why don’t you sit down,” she said. “I’m sure you’ll have a chance to talk later.”

Octavia walked back to her desk and sat down.

As she was sitting, she noticed that the boy in the seat next to her was staring at her. He had been staring at her all through the summer.

“Hey,” he said. “My name’s Ryan.”

“Hey,” Octavia said.

“You’re Octavia, right?” he asked.

“Yeah,” she said.

“I’ve seen you around,” he said. “But we’ve never really talked before.”

“No,” she said.

“So what did you do this summer?

**Her parents had finally gotten a divorce. Which meant no more yelling at each other, not more silent dinners, and no more family. Her best friend, Steve, had tried to make her feel better by telling her she would have two Christmases, but that didn’t help.**
It was hard to go from having a big family to having none. She knew that her parents loved her, but now she couldn’t even talk to them without it turning into an argument. She wanted to talk to them about the divorce, but she didn’t want to hear them say they were sorry, because they weren’t. She couldn’t talk to them about the divorce because she was the one who had told them they were getting a divorce. 
She hadn’t meant to tell them. It just kind of came out one night when she was at Steve’s house. She was on the phone with him when her dad came home from work. Her mom was already there, and they were having a fight. She had said something about getting a divorce and then, like the open faucet she was, she couldn’t stop the words from pouring out of her mouth. She didn’t want a divorce, but she knew her parents did. They weren’t happy anymore. They were just two people who were forced to live together. 
Steve had told her that she had to do something about it, but she didn’t know what to do. She was just a kid, and it was her parents’ decision. But Steve said that she had to try. She knew that it would be hard, but she didn’t know how hard it would be. 
Steve had also told her that she would have to tell her parents that she was moving in with him and his family. Her parents didn’t like Steve, but they liked his family even less. They didn’t like the fact that his mom was in jail and his dad was never around. They didn’t like that Steve had to go to the store to buy his own food. But she liked that he didn’t have a lot of money. He didn’t have a lot of stuff. He didn’t need a lot of stuff. He didn’t have to be nice to people he didn’t like, and he didn’t have to worry about the things other kids worried about. 
She didn’t like being poor, but she liked Steve. She didn’t want to move in with him, but she wanted to stay with him. He was her best friend. He was the only one who understood her. He was the only one who was

Then, her grandmother had gotten sick and died. She had been really close to her grandmother and the only person who had been there for her since her parents had gotten divorced.
She had thought that things were going to be okay. That she would be okay. But then, the day after her grandmother died, she had woken up to a different life.
She had gotten to school to see that she had been assigned to a new classroom, a new seat, and a new teacher. Her old teacher had told her that she had been assigned to the special class for students with behavioral problems. The class that had gotten a new student: Todd.
It was then that she had realized that things were not going to be okay.
“What did you do over the summer?” Mrs. Roger asked.
“I had to move,” she said, looking down at her hands.
“Where did you move to?” Mrs. Roger asked.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” she said, trying to keep the tears out of her voice.
“Why not?” Mrs. Roger asked.
“Because I don’t,” she said.
“Are you okay?” Mrs. Roger asked.
“I’m fine,” she said, “I just don’t want to talk about it.”

She wasn’t okay. She was angry. She was angry that her parents had gotten a divorce. She was angry that her grandmother had died. She was angry that she had to move. She was angry that she was in this stupid class.
She was angry that her parents didn’t love her anymore.
She was angry that Todd was in her class.

Mrs. Roger looked at the class and decided to change the subject. “Who can tell me something about the school?” she asked.
“The school is on fire,” someone said.
“We are going to die,” another said.
“The aliens have taken over the school,” said another.
Mrs. Roger waited a moment for someone to stop the ridiculous comments. “I guess I should have specified that I wanted something positive,” she said.

“Our teacher is a vampire,” someone said.
“She is

As she tried to gather her thoughts, she thought about the divorce and how she hadn’t seen her parents for weeks. And, although she was happy that they had stopped fighting, it meant that she didn’t get to see them. She didn’t even know where they were staying. It was like they had just disappeared. 
Her dad was probably with his new girlfriend. Her mom had to be with someone too, because her mom was too old to live alone. She thought that her mom was probably living with her new boyfriend, and her dad was probably living with his.
She had asked her older brother, Nick, where they were staying, but he just said he didn’t know. That made her mad. He knew something, she was sure of it. 
She was snapped out of her thoughts by a voice saying, “Octavia, you’re up.”
She looked up to see Mrs. Roger smiling at her.

She’d gone to his house for a while but, as much as she loved his parents, it wasn’t the same. She’d tried to spend as much time as she could with her friend, Caroline, but she had also spent a lot of time by herself. 
It had been a pretty lonely summer.
The bell rang. She was relieved that the class had ended. She had done her best but, looking back, she thought it had been a terrible talk. She stood up and began to gather her things. She could feel everyone’s eyes on her. 
“Octavia?” Mrs. Roger asked. “Would you stay for a minute?”
She sighed. She didn’t want to stay but she didn’t want to leave the classroom either. She wanted to get out of there.
“I’ll be right back,” she told the teacher.
“OK,” Mrs. Roger said. “We’ll talk when you get back.”
Octavia walked down the hall, and turned the corner. She didn’t want to go to the office but she didn’t want to stay in the classroom either. She took a deep breath and walked into the office.
Octavia sat on the couch in the office and tried to think of a good excuse for why she wasn’t in her classroom. It was so much easier when she was younger and she could say she had to use the bathroom. Now that she was in 6th grade she didn’t have that excuse anymore. 
The secretary walked out from behind the desk.
“I’m going to get Mrs. Roger,” she said. “She’ll be out in a minute.”
“Thanks,” Octavia said.
“So,” the secretary said, as she walked back to her desk. “How was your summer?”
Octavia was confused. Why was the secretary asking her that?
“Fine,” she answered.
“Good,” the secretary said. “Did you do anything fun?”
“No,” Octavia answered.
“Oh,” the secretary said. “I hope you have a good year.”
Octavia didn’t know
