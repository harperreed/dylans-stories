**Octavia took a deep breath and opened her eyes. The class was still there. She had hoped that somehow closing her eyes would have made them go away. Her eyes darted around the room and saw Mrs. Roger’s smile at her, encouraging her to start her talk. **
**It was the first day of 6th grade and, as was usual at the start of a new school year, they were being forced to talk about what they did over their summer vacation. That was the last thing she wanted to talk about. Summer had sucked. **
**Her parents had finally gotten a divorce. Which meant no more yelling at each other, not more silent dinners, and no more family. Her best friend, Steve, had tried to make her feel better by telling her she would have two Christmases, but that didn’t help.**
She opened her mouth and had to read from the paper she was holding. 
“I went to Florida with my mom. I spent most of the time in her studio.” 
“Tell us about the Disneyworld,” said a boy she knew from school. Everyone knows it had been created by Satan. He had hoped the boy would use the correct pronunciation and sound like a simpleton.
Mrs. Roger smiled at the smartass remark impatiently and told Bradford to let her speak. She was always doing that.
“Well, I didn’t go there,” there was a ripple of laughter through the class, “I watched my mother paint milk white for an entire weekend.” 
“You never spent time with your father?” Octavia looked with disgust at Sheila, the last person in the class who had ever felt the embarrasment of having to ask permission to go to the bathroom.
Asida had her head down, unable to prevent her right shoulder from twitching upward in sympathy. Octavia and Sheila had been in a full out brawl last year and had been meeting in the guidance counselor’s office once or twice a week since the school year had started again. Asking permission to go to the bathroom. How disgusting could one get?
But Sheila was also one of the class smartasses, and some kind of incident was bound to happen soon. Maybe Octavia would punch her. That would be fun to see. 
“Well, I missed my father when I was young, so I thought I would get to know him, closer. It was very surreal. We inevitably brought out the worst in each other and became so frustrated with the other that we didn’t speak for hours. I got the feeling that he blamed his moving away on me, and distanced us even further. By Monday we were waiting by the school bus, without telling each other bye or thank you or anything. It was odd to begin with, but it was odd afterwords.” 
“Wow! Victor!” Peter and Bill clapped in appreciation. Evidently, they were Peter and Bill again. Octavia shook her head; something was wrong. This wasn’t how it’d been supposed to go. 
“Fascinating,” said Mrs. Roger. “Thank you for hasting that. Let’s move on to the

**Her parents had finally gotten a divorce. Which meant no more yelling at each other, not more silent dinners, and no more family. Her best friend, Steve, had tried to make her feel better by telling her she would have two Christmases, but that didn’t help.**
There was nothing remotely fun about two Christmases, both lonely and sad, and all of that in rapid succession.
After spending most of the summer brooding over things she should have said and should have done, she knew she had to take action. She had to make things happen. And so, for the first day of school, she had decided to do something spectacular or die trying. 
And now she had to do what she had seen in the movies–stand up ,and in a strong, clear, and loud voice, tell the class what had happened. Wait, no. Not what had happened. She realized she should say what SHE thought happened. She didn’t want them thinking it was a boring movie. 
While she was busy thinking about what she should say Octavia suddenly became aware of Mrs. Roger’s eyes on her. Octavia used all her concentration to lift her hand. 
“Octavia, is there something wrong? You look a bit flushed.”
Octavia opened her mouth to correct Mrs. Roger, but thought better of it and quickly nodded. That was it. A nod, and she could sit down!
Mrs. Roger sighed. “Cut a reel girl, go on. You don’t want to sit down now .”
“Yes , Mrs. Roger.” Octavia was mortified. Octavia was convinced she could feel every eye in the class on her, laughing at her. She swallowed. She couldn’t do it.
“Octavia Smith Mehneye is at school today!”
“I’ve always wanted to say the things I’m about to say. And now, today, is awesome. It’s even cooler than the day I found Superman #160—the weekend edition--in the dollar bin at the drug store. Hell, this day is easier to get through than when I colored Easter eggs and realized they would never come out the way they were supposed to if you colored the shells before you dyed them.
And hey, I don’t have to knock on wood. This is the day Octavia Smith Mehneye becomes a real girl .
Today is the day I wake up in Anna’s house and pretend that I don’t really belong there until I spend every precious minute I can hogging her shower and then cooking a meal in her kitchen. Just so you know, when

Octavia closed her eyes again and started to talk.

Octavia opened her eyes. She had done it. She had survived the speech. She let out a sigh of relief and went back to contemplating the forms in front of her.
Octavia sighed and picked up her pencil. This was going to be a long year.

Here at Desert Tech Middle School the kids’ lives were much better than hers. Everyone seemed to have someone.
Over there a group of kids were together in a corner saying their summer involved water polo, swimming, and out of state trips to Disney World. Two girls looked like they had gone to France.
And what seemed to be the most important thing: they all seemed to have some sort of camp or program they were involved in. But what she couldn’t understand was what all these programs and camps were. Over there were older kids talking about some program called summer bridge and how it helped them to be prepared for high school. A few returned campers were talking about how cool Camp Wilderness was. One boy from third grade claimed he spent his summer at All Star Basketball Camp.
Then a girl in Mrs. Roger’s class talked about how great it was to travel to her Grandma’s home in Amsterdam, how they went to a museum and learned about art.
Every time someone talked about their summer it seemed like the summer following the baby boom and kids from 1947 were being celebrated. Every kid had a great experience. They had traveled. Some had been to Europe, others to Canada, or even lived in Europe for six weeks, others were on a crew for a summer. One boy couldn’t go to his family’s summer home in Maine, but he still had a great summer because he spent it at camp. A few kids had said they had went to Florida, North Carolina or even used words like Cooperstown, Cooper River, Hell and Little Eagle.
After hearing all this information about these great places, Trip and Xander’s experience was nothing, and they seemed to be the only ones in the class without a great summer. And if everyone else had these great experiences, what place was left for her?
But her pattern of not good stuff happening continued. Over a thousand miles from her belonged two best friends attended Esprit de Voyage Academy where they were learning French, dancing and art.
But Julian and Alice still didn’t have kids of the first year of hope starting sixth grade. They didn’t have to deal with rabid six year olds who haven’t realized their whole lives ahead of then.
They still could claim they were special; they didn’t have to go back to school, they could probably wait until late August. Their summers were what they would remember forever. And maybe that’s

**Her parents had finally gotten a divorce. Which meant no more yelling at each other, not more silent dinners, and no more family. Her best friend, Steve, had tried to make her feel better by telling her she would have two Christmases, but that didn’t help.**
Anything was better than her parents living together but not together and in some twisted way, there was a lot of baggage that came along with that.

Octavia wasn’t sure she could actually go through with her speech if she tried. Suddenly, Mr. Dalton spoke up and said that he thought this might be too difficult for the kids and that maybe they should 
pick a different topic. He was immediately shushed by Mrs. Roger. The teacher always reminded everyone that her classroom would be age appropriate, and this was a perfect speech topic for 6th graders. 
Octavia opened her mouth and got ready to say something when her eyes darted to the back of the room, where Ray, her older sister, sat glaring back at her. Not at her, exactly, but at the people behind her. So many of the students were chatting with each other. Octavia noticed, aggravating for her to know that she had to perform all by herself. She turned 
and faced the class silently pleading with them to pay attention. Still no one said anything.
None of the students were even looking at her. They were listening to Mr. Dalton talk to another adult. She turned back around. 

Her eyes landed on Ray again. With Ray being older, not two-years-older, but seven-years-old older, and then with the divorce…. it 
meant that she got to start middle school a year before Octavia. In addition, the whole family was walking on eggshells around each other. Octavia watch Ray’s eyes narrow as she 
turned around looking at the classroom behind her, annoyance in her eyes. Octavia watched the students talking, not paying attention to the speech, and knew what she had to do. 
She wasn’t allowed to hit people. Her parents had taught her that, but all of their other rules of life didn’t apply anymore. She whipped around, anticipating the other kids would 
immediately stop talking and give her their full attention. But they didn’t. None of them had even seen her slam her hands on the desk and yell, “Quiet!!” Everyone went
silent, startled by loud yell. Octavia stood there silently, taking in what she had just done.
Octavia stood there silently, facing the class. They were all staring at her. She opened her mouth and said,

An ancient idea came to her. She would stand up and tell everyone her vacation was super special. A terrific unicorn had appeared one morning while she was eating cereal, and it transported her to the Land of Ecspectulate Beasts where she played with all of the amazing beings and ate walrus snout and something called ferret turnips.
They would be stunned and awed. FurTHERmOre, they would be very impressed that she could recognize ferret turnips just by tasting them. Her parents might figure out that all of her lies were lies and never send her to her grandparents ever again. 
Her hand trembled slightly as she reached for her cup. Still, she had to do it. She could not fail this class. She had to talk and be smart. The words of a poem she had researched for her summer reading homework came to her mind. She opened her mouth and without a single pause, began to speak. 

“I hate poetry.” Octavia growled as she slurped another bite of clam chowder. Her tone echoed her opinion of the yellow page cloth. Printed with textiles, it bunched and drooped about. Somewhere beneath the texture, white letters read “Concrete restaurant.” Octavia attacked the lettering with her fork, wondering why the art director would put it into print when she could have designed a paper napkin. Or, at the very least, chosen something with cohesiveness. She flicked the remainder of clumped symbols onto her plate.
Mrs. Palmer, the former eleventh grade English teacher, continued to hum to herself and clip her fingernails. Her finger nails, like herself, were mildly intimidating. They managed to be thin and pointy, yet they also tapered in two directions. Octavia had never met a fingernail with the energy needed to grow up in a steeply vertical plane and then curve gently on the horizontal.
Her mind wandered to her Math teacher, Mr. Orolfo.
He had an odd fashion sense. He matched different pairs of socks every day. One day, he’d wear red and blue striped socks with sandals. The next, he’d wear glasses made with black studs and a bow tie. 
“Okay, so Octavia.” Mrs. Palmer oozed nuclear pressure onto the vowels in her name.
Octavia snapped back the dreary graveyard of her mind. “Dessert?

Leaning slightly into the microphone and slowly raising her hand to her chest, she said, “I am Octavia Shardon. I moved here from Michigan.” And then she closed her mouth and wished she could disappear.

The story was written by Hughes while she was in the sixth grade. It was inspired by one of her best friend’s mothers who had divorced her husband. Hughes believed that the mother revealed too much personal information, and thought that could get the woman into trouble. She decided she would write a story about a girl that told an untruth, and give her a name similar to the friend’s name. The story was created after Hughes Labrador Retriever, Conan the Librarian, jumped up on her keyboard as she was preparing dinner. Hughes was about to begin typing, when she saw Conan, and sent broom him. His paws hit “the q and z”, disrupting what she had written. Hughes was upset and yelled, "Conan, you stupid dog, you knocked over my letter Q and Z!" This is when she decided to put the main character’s name as Octavia Q. Shardon. 
The first phone call was made to an agent, with a pitch for the manuscript on January 3, 1998. She met her an agent, Rosemary Stimola, in Manhattan a few weeks later, and on January 26, 1998, Stimola not only became Hughes’ agent, but sold her manuscript to HarperCollins.
In “How to Write Squeaky Clean Picture Books”, an essay written by Hughes and published at Teachers & Writers magazine, Hughes explains to her readers about the 183 rejections her book went through before it was published. She says, “I picked up my book and slunk home. After all the effort and anticipation, I was humiliated, to say the least… It was on my kitchen table, this shining little gem that I, as its author, couldn’t possibly have, and yet… my name was on the cover.” Hughes called her agent, in tears, and asked her what to do. Her agent had told her to keep submitting the book until a publishing company picked up her book. “Speak,” Hughes continued, “that confused, quivering, valiant little pup propelled onward, realizing that Octavia had to tell HER side of the story.” 




The book was well received by most critics, and was

Young Octavia was in the car, holding her dad as he yelled at her mother. She didn’t know why he was so mad, but she could tell he wasn’t going to hurt her. She had seen him push her mom on the couch once, but she knew that was wrong and her daddy loved her mom. 
Was her mom really going to live with her grandmother in Idaho? 
She wanted her mom back with their family, even if didn’t mean her and Steve could play in the treehouse.

Would she ever see Steve again? 
Bobby, the guy on the basketball team who always lent her tape when her dad didn’t bring the right kind, asked her if she wanted to go out with him and his friends. The other girls kept asking her if he was her boyfriend, but she said, no. 
The other girls called her friendship stupid in Junior High now that she had “Bobby”. Her hair and clothes suddenly got within the code for cool, but this time in a different manner. Bobby asked her if she wanted to go with him and his friends to see the new Dracula movie. It wasn’t scary, but it was exciting. Then, at the crucial moment, when the killing was supposed to start, Bobby kissed her. 
Octavia took another deep breath, opened her eyes, and wondered if Bobby ever kissed some other girl on the first day of school.

Mrs. Roberts said, “Alright Taylor, its your turn.” 
Octavia had been thinking about her streak that day. Well, no, technically, it was night. 
It occurred to her that night was the best time for streaks because no one could see if you missed one. 
When she told her mom about her track star idea in February, her mother insisted on strength training. Now, her shoulders, arms, and legs were all much bigger. It made her uncomfortable because it didn’t seem right. Didn’t the stronger girls have bigger breasts? Steve used to tease her about them in the 8th grade. He finally stopped when he realized she wasn’t even as big as his sister. 
Her mother was strict about hygiene, so she wasn’t as strong on that point. Grooming kept her busy. After her shower (daily in the summer), her shoulder-length hair had to have special conditioner, then it was parted

She wiped her eyes and looked up as two eyes peered at her suspiciously. “What’s this? You cheating already?”
“No!” 
“Move your eyes back on Octavia.”
She cringed when Mrs. Roger said her name. Knowing it was that Octavia was all she had to used to decide she didn’t want to look at her.
She finally looked at Steve and cringed again. He was giving her the sort of grin that implied he was about to tell her a horrid joke. Lines creased his face that hadn’t been there yesterday still laughing about the last time he wore his little brother’s shoes to school. 
“Did you go to camp this year?” she asked quickly.
“Nope. I always go to the family summer house this time of year.”
Escape! Her family went to their summer house and never really turned a phone on. No ‘Keep in touch’, No ‘Are you getting out enough?’, Just sleeping in and swimming in the ocean.
She kept her mouth shut for the first time that day. Her parents hadn’t been into using cell phones either. She used to get on them after dinner and tell her friends all the cool lighthouse ghost stories until she was about twelve. Also the big walk-in freezer in the store had her in constant teenage awe.
Octavia was lost in her thoughts when she saw a framed picture in the corner of the room. The man in the black and white photo had come to live with them for a week through some kind of work program. His position was ‘supervisor’, but being just a few years older than her and one of the few kids in her year to completely their high school and go to college, he had decided handing her a shovel was a good way for her to spend one of their long and boring construction breaks.
The three of them (her Mother, Richard and herself) had skipped the beaches by the family house and tried to dig a hole. A big one. They thought they were digging another hole a few weeks before, but her left leg and right side of her lower back had screamed at her the next day that it had been a half-hearted try. Her mother had taken her aside then to tell her that getting more tools and some more assisting hands would help. Richard, who got

She had secretly wanted her parents to stop loving each other. It was a shallow solution and she knew it, but neither she nor her parents were ready to accept their faults and keep the family.
Summer was the loneliest time because that was when she didn’t have Steve or her family to keep her company. She knew she was lucky in a way because many kids never got the support she had every step of the way as her parents tried to save their marriage.
They had all gone to counseling, but it just couldn’t be!
Still, would it have hurt anyone to pretend to like each other in front of her for one summer? One summer! She didn’t mean forever!
“Honey? Do you want a drink?” her dad asked, stirring her from her (very deep) thoughts.
“No thanks.” She shook her head. Her throat was parched.
She wished she could hate them both. Normally, if someone asked her how she was doing she would have muttled out an, “Okay.” Now a ‘okay’ for Octavia was the clinical definition for her actual feelings.
“Do you want lemonade?” her dad asked.
Octavia smiled at him, despite her disgust. Custard. “Okay,” she said.
Her dad raised his eyebrows at her, then set Octavia’s school bag down and went into the kitchen to get her lemonade. Already, after only three days of school, Octavia had the feeling that her summer was just slipping away and she was sitting there with her hands tied behind her back, letting the time and opportunity slip through them.
No doubt she would start at least five projects at home and her mother would convince her to put them in a drawer or drop the project. Either way it would be a loss. Or her mother would force her to go swimming, or to “just laugh”, or to come watch “her favorite movie.”
Her father came out of the kitchen, dripping lemonade as he walked over to Octavia. She rose to give the cup to him and he smiled and dropped the bag in her lap.
“No Octavia, give it back to me. You’ll drop it and then we’ll both be crying,” her dad said and sat down beside her.
His brown hair was getting
